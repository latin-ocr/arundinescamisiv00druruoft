Humi Chloe, dear Chloe, 1'11 tell you some news;
I've just learnt it myself‚ and I cannot refuse ς
It's odd and its awkward to tell—shut the door,
Lest some listening raseal my secret explore.
We're alone—I can't tell it—yet, somehow I feel
It is equally stubborn and hard to eonceal;
There's nothing in silence, so let the word pase,

I but knew it this morning—I love thee, my lass! l

Ξ THE Battle of Gladsmuir, it was a noble stour,

³ And weel do we know that our young prinee won: g
2 The gallant Lowland lade, when they saw our tartan plaids,
Ἰ Wheeled round to the right and away they run! , ³

For Master J ohnnie Oope, being destitute of hope,
ᾖ Took horse for his life and left his men;

In their arms he put nae trust, for he kenned it wa' just,}

That the king should enjoy his ain agen. ἑ
