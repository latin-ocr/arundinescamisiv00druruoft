ARUNDINES CAMI.

Around from all the neighbouring streets

The wondering neighbours ran,
And swore the dog had lost his wits,
To bite so good a man.

The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye;

And while they swore the dog was mad,
They swore the man would die.

But soon a wonder came to light,
That shewed the rogues they lied;

The man recovered of the bite;
The dog it was that died.

Am) now, my rane of terror run,
Mine be the eve of tropic sun3

No pale gradations quench his ray,

No twilight dews his wrath allay3
With disk like battle-target red,

He rushes to his burning bed;

Dyes the wide wave with bloody light;
Then siuks at once—and all is night.
