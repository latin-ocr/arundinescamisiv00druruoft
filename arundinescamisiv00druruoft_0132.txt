ARUNDINES CAMl.

OEbe πίῃ] Sebuinus.

GAREFUL observers may foretell the honr,
By sure prognostiCS‚ when to dread a shower.

While rain depende, the pensive cat gives o'er —

Her frolies, and pursues her tail 110 more.
Returning home at night, you'll find the sink

Strike your offended sense with double stink.
If you be wisse, then go not far to dine;

You'll spend in eoaeh hire more than save in wine.
A coming shower your shooting coms presage;
Old aehes will throb‚ your hollow tooth will rage3

Sauntering in eoffee-house is Dulman seen3

He damus the elimate and complains of spleen.

Meanwhile the South‚ rising with dabbled wingS‚
A sable cloud athwart the welkin flingS,

That swill'd more liquor than it could contain,
And, like a drunkard‚ gives it up again.

Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope,

While the first drizzling shower is borne aslope:

Such is that sprinkling, which some careless quean-

Flirts on you from her mop‚ but not 80 elean;
