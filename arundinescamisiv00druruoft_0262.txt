ARUNDINES CAMI.

And thinks the wide-stressehed watery soene

Fair meadows clad in vernal green:

So oft my fancy turns to view

Those forms my livelier momente knew,
And kindling at delusione vain,
Believes and hopes them back again.
Then if I court their imaged charmS, ²
My fevered soul is up in armS;

And siekening nature proves at last

The passion weak, the moment past.
Merivale.
