ARUNDINES CAMl.

satiata.

Ο Low, Love‚ Love! Ο withering might!
Ο sun, that from thy noonday height
Shudderest when I strain my sight,
Throbbing through all thy heat and light!
Lo! falling from my constant mind,
Lo! patched and withered‚ deas and blind,

I whirl like leaves in roaring wind.

Last night I wasted hateful hours
Below the city's eastern towers:
I thirsted for the brookS‚ the showers:

Ι rolled among the tendet flowers;
I crush'd them on my breast‚ my mouth:

I look'd athwart the burning drouth
Of that long desert to the south.

Last night when some one spoke his name,
From my swift blood that went and came,
A thousand little shafts of fiame
Were shiver'd in my narrow frame.
Ο Love‚ Ο fire! once he drew
With one long kiss my whole soul through
My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew,
