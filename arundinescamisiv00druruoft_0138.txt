ARUNDINES CAMI.

&uem mah.

GoMm follow, follow me,

You Faery elves that be,
Which circle on the green,
Come follow Mab your queen:
Hand in hand let's danee around,
For this place 15 Faery ground.

When mortals are at rest,

And snoring in their nest,
Unheard and unespied

Through keyholes we do glide;
Over tables stools and shelves
We trip it with our Faery elveS.

Upon a mushroom bed
Our table eloth we spread;
A grain of rye 01· wheat
Is manehet which we eat;

Pearly drops of dew we drink
In acorn oups filled to the brink. ¹

The brains of nightingales‚

With unctuous fat of snaiIS,

Between two cockles stewed,

Ι5 meat that's easily chewed:

Tails of worms, and marrow of 111100,
Do make a dish that's wondrous nice.
