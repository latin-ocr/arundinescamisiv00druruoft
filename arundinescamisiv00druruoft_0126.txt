ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEhe matina of the ᾖῂίρε.

WHEN o'er the silent seas alone

For days and nights we've 6116611633 gone,
Oh those who've felt it, know* how sweet
Some sunny mom a sail to meet ἱ
Sparkling at once is every eye,

⁶ Ship ahoy! ship ahoy !' our joyful ery3
And answering back the sounds we hear,

‘ Ship ahoy! ship ahoy! what cheer, what cheer ζ’
Τ11611 sails are baeked, we nearer eome;
Kind words are said of friends and home—
Till soon, too soon, we part with pain,

To sail o'er silent seas again.

MISTRESS Mary,
Quite contrary, .

.How does your garden grew?
With silver bells

And cockle shells
And hyacinthe all of a row.
