ARUNDINES CAMI.

Or thee perehance a darker spell
Enthralls: the smooth stones of the flood‚
By mountain grot or fell,
Pollute with infant's blood3

The giant altar on the wok,

The eavern whence the timbrel's call
Affrights the wandel-ing flock :--
Thou' long'st to search them all.

Trust not the dangerous path again—
Ο forward step and lingering will!
Ο loved and warned in vain ἰ ’
’ And wilt thou perish still?

Thy message given, thine home in sight,
To the forbidden feast return?

Yield to ¹the *false delight

Thy better soul could spurnss

Alas‚ my brother ἱ round thy tomb

In sorrow kneeling‚ and in sear,
We read the Pastor's doom‚

Who speaks and will not hear. ⁴

The gray haired saint may fail at last,
The surest guide a wanderer prove;
Death only binds us fast
To the bright shore of love.
