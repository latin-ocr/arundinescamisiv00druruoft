I ΒΗΜΛ, see him, but not now:

I shall behold him, but not nigh:

There shall come a Star out of Jacob,

And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel,

And shall smite the corners of Moab,

And destroy all the children of Sheth.

And Edom shall be a possession,

Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies;
And Israel shall do valiantly. ¹

Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion,
And shall destroy him that remaineth in the city.
Amalek was the first of nations,

But his latter end shall be,

That- he shall perish for ever.

WnY should this earth delight us so?
Why should we fix our eyes

On these low grounds, where sorrows grew,

And every pleasure dies?
