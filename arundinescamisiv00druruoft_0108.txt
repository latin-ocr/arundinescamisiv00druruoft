Qud.

‘ TH0U‚ whose spel] can raise the dead,

     

Bid the prophet's form. appear.'

   

j ‘ Samuel, raise thy buried head ἔ
King, behold the phantom seer?

   
 

  

Earth yawned: he stood the centre of a cloud:
Light changed its hue retiring from his shroud:
Death stood all glassy in his fixed eye3

His hands were withered and his veins were dry:
His foot in boney whiteness glittered there,
Shrunken and sinewless and ghastly bare:

From lips that moved not and unbreathing frame‚

Like caverned winds the hollow accents came.
Saul saw, and fell to earth, as falls the oak
At once, and blasted by the thunder stroke.

Is it thou, O King Z—Behold
Bloodless are these limbs and eold ε

     

Such are mine; and such shall be
Thine to-morrow when with me.

Ere the coming day is done ἰ
Such shalt thou be, such thy son. ΙΙ
Fare thee well! but for a day3 Ι

Then we mix our mouldering clay. Ι
