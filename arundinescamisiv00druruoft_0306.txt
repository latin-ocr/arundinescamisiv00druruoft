Ο LORD, the Saviour and defenee
Of us thy chosen mee,
From age to age Thou still hast been

Our sure abiding 'place

Before Thou broughtest the mountains forth,
Or the earth and world didst frame,
Thou always wert the mighty God,

And ever art the same.

Thou turnest man, O Lord‚ to dust,
Of whieh he first was made, Q
And when Thou speakest the word, ‘Return‚' A

'Tis instantly obeyed,

For in thy sight a thousand years
Are like a day that's past,
Or like a wateh in dead of night,

Whose hours unminded waste.

Thou sweepest us off as ¹{avith a flood,

We vanish hence like dreams: .
At first we grow like grass that feels

The sun's reviving beams;
