ARUNDIN Es CAMI.

OEn wath.

Tuon bidst me come away,
And I'll no longer stay,
Than for to shed some tears
For faults of former ysam,
And to repent some crimes
Done in the present times;
Το don my robes of love
Fit for the plane above3
To gird my loins about
With charity throughout:
And so to travel hence
With feet of innocenoe.
This done, I'll only cry

'⁶ Grod mercy !'-—and so die.

Brmmvn a sleeping infant lies-
Το earth his body lent,

Herfflfter shall more glorious riso,
But not more innocent.

And when the, arch angePs trump shall blow,

And souls to bodies join‚
Thousands will wish their lives below
Had been as short as thine.
