Grin you're sae douce ye sneer at this,
You're nought but senseless asses O:
The wisest man the warl e'er saw,
He dearly loved the lasses O.

Green grow the rushes, O:

Green grow the rushes O:

The sweetest hours that e'er I spent,
Were spent among the lasses O.

Auld Nature swears the lovely dears
Her noblest work she classes O;
Her 'prentice hand she tried 011 man,
And then she made the lasses Ο.

Green grow the rushes O:

 

Green grew the rushes O:
The sweetest hours that e'er Ι spent⁷
Were spent among the lasses O!

DmK cannot wipe his 'nostrils when he pleases‚
His nose so long is, and his arm so short:
And never eries ⁶ God bless me Γ when he sneezes‚

He cannot hear 5ο distant a report.
