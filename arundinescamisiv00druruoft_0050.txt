ARUNDINES CAMI.

oupm auh OEampazpe.

Oupm and my Gampaspe play'd
At cardes for kisses; Cupid pay'd:
He stakes his quiver‚ bow and arrOWS‚
His mother's doves, and teame of sparrows3
Loses them too; then down he throws
The eoral of his lippe, the rose
Growing on's cheek (but none knows how);
With* these the crystal of his browe,
And then the dimple of his chinne3 1
All these did my Gampaspe winne.
At last he set her both his eyes;
She won, and Gupid blind did rise.
Ο Love! has she done this to thee?
What shall alas ! become of mee?

Quiza, Quian! Amy §iatine Scabore.

⁴⁶ Ammo, adieu! my native shore

Fades o'er the waters blue;
The Night-winds sigh‚ the breakers mar, x
And shrieks the wild sea-meW.
Yon Sun that sets upon the sea
We follow in his flight3
Farewell awhile to him and thee,
My native Land—-Good Night!
