188 ARUNDINES CAMI.

‘ And has he left the birds and flowerS,
And must I eall in vain?

And through the long long summer hours
Will he not come again?

And by the brook and in the glade

Are all our wanderings 'o'er‘ss
O! while my brother with me played
Would I had loved him more Γ

WITH fairest flowerS,
Whilst summer laste, and I live here, Fidele,
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
The flower, that's like thy face, pale primrose3 nor
‚The azure harebell, like thy veins; n0, nor
The leaf of eglantine, which not to slander,
Out-sweetened not thy breath: the ruddock would,
With eharitable bill (O bill, sore shaming

, Those rich left heim, that let their fathers lie
² Without a monument !) bring thee all this;

Yea, and furred moss beside, when flowers are none,

To winter-ground thy corse.
Shakspeare.
