Om· in the stilly night,

Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Fond Memory brings the light

Of other days around me.

The smileS‚ the teate, of boyhood's yeme,

The words of love then spoken3

The eyes that shone, now dimmed and gone;
The eheerful hearts now broken.

When I remember all
The friends so linked together,

I've seen around me fall, ,
Like leaves in wintry weather;

I feel like one who treads alone
Some> banquet hall deserted,

Whose lights are fied, whose garlands dead,
And all but he departed!

Bm baby bunting‚

Father's gone a hunting,
Mother's gone a milking,
Sister's gone a silking‚
Brother's gone to buy a skin
To wrap Baby Bunting in.
