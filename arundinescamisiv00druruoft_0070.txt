 

ARUNDINES CAMI.
It is to gaze upon her eyes
With eager joy and fond surprize,
Yet temper'd with such ohaste and awful fear,
As wretches feel* who wait their doom3

Nor must one ruder thought presume,

Though but in whispers breathed, to meet her ear. .

It is to hope, though hope were lost,
Though heaven and earth thy wishes cross'd:
Though she were bright as sainted queens above,
And thou the least and meanest swain
That folds his flock upon the plain,
Yet if thou darest not hope, thou dost not love.

It isto quenoh thy joy in tearS,
To nurse strange thoughts and groundless fears:
If pangs of jealousy thou hast not proved,
Though she were fonder and more true
Than any nymph old poets dreW,
ÎŸ never dream again that thou hast loved.

If, when the darling maid is gone,
Thou dost not seek to be alone,

Rapt in a pleasing trance of tender woe3
And muse and sold thy languid armS,
Feeding thy fancy on her eharmS,

Thou dost not lovffi-for love is nourish'd 80.
