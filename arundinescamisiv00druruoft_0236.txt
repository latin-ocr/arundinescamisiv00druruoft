ARUNDINES CAMI.

Still in that breast thy country held her throne,

Thy toil, thy fear, thy prayer were hers alone,
Thy last faint effort hers, and hers thy parting groan.

Heber.

OEbe Ξιβίταιεέ ῧατεὶυείῑ.

'FAREwEm farewell !——the voice you hear
Has left its last soft tone with you;

Its next must join the seaward oheer
And shout among the shouting crew.

The amente, which I scaree could form
Beneath your frown's controlling check,

Must give the word, above the storm,
To cut the mast and clear the wreek.

The timid eye I (iared not raise,
The hand that shook when pressed to thine‚

Must point the guns upon the ehase,
Must bid the deadly cutlass shine.

To all I love or hope or fear,
Honour or own—a long adieu!
To all that life 1136 soft and dear,

Farewell--save memory of you!
