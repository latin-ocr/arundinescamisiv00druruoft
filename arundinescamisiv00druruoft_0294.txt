ARUNDINES CAMI.

How they said,

Down with it, down with it, ev'en to the ground.
ο daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery,
Yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee

As thou hast served us,

Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children,
And throweth them against the stoneS.

Psalm cxxxvii.

——ae-

{Lautum

BANISHED the house of sacred rest,
Amid a thoughtless throng,

At length I heard its creed confessed‚
And knelt the saints among.

Artless his strain and unadorned,
Who spoke Christ's message there3
But what at home I might have scomed‚

Now charmed my famished ear.

Lord‚ grant me this abiding grace,
Thy words and sons' to know3

To pierce the veil on Moses' face,
Although his speech be slow.

Lyra Apostohca.
