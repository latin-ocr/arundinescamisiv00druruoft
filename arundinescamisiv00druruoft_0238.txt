ΤοΜ, Tom‚ the piper's son,
Stole a pig, and away he run:
The pig was eat, and Tom was beat,

And Tom. ran erying down the street.

DEAE is my little native vale,
The ringdove builds and murmurs there,
Olose to my cot she tells her tale
To every passing villager3
The squirrel leaps from tree to tree‚
And shells his nuts at liberty.

Through orange groves and myrtle bowers
That breathe a gale of fragranee round,
I eharm the fairy-footed hours
With the loved lute's romantio sound;
Or erowns of living laurel weave‚
For those that win the raoe at eve.

The Shepherd's horn at break of day,
The ballet daneed in twilight shade;
The oanzonet and roundelay
Sung in the silent greenwood glade‚
These simple joys that never fail
Shall bind me to my native vale. . “
