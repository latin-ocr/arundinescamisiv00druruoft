'OEn a ‘itane

Too late I stayed, forgive the orime;
Unheeded flew the hours:

How hoiseless falls the foot of· Time
That only treads on flowers!

What eye with clear account remarks
The ebbing of the glaSS,

When all the sands are diamond sparkS‚
That dazzle as they pass?

Ah 2 who to sober measurement
Time's happy swiftness bringS‚

When birds of Paradise have lent

Their plumage to his wdngs?
W. Spenser.
