THREE children sliding on the· ice

All on a summer's day,
V As it fell out, they all fell in‚—-⁴ ·
The rest they ran away.

       
  

Now had these children been at school,
Or sliding on dry ground,

Ten· thousand pounds to one penny

They had not all been d‘rowned.

   

 

      
  

You parents that have children dear‚
ἶ And eke you that have none,
5 If you will have them safe abroad,

ξ Pray keep them safe at home.
