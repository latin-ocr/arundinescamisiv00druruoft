ARUNDINES CA ΜΙ.

{aurp uf the North.

HARP of the North, farewell! The hills grow dark,
On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;

In twilight eopse the glow-worm lights her spark;
The deer half-seen are to the covert wending.

Resume thy wizard elm! the fountain lending‚
And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;

Thy numbers sweet with nature's vespers blending‚
With distant echo from the fold and lea,

And herdboy”s evening pipe and hum of housing bee.

Yet once again farewell, thou minstrel Harp!

Yet once again forgive my feeble sway3
And little reck I of the censure sharp
May idly cavil at an idle lay.
Mueh have I owed thy stra-ins on life's long way,

Through secret woes the world has never known,

η When on the weary night dawned wearier day,

And bitterer was the grief devoured alone.

That I o'erlive such woeS‚ EnohantreSS‚ is thine own!

Scott.
