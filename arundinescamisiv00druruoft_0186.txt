ΤΗ 1s little pig went to market‚

This little pig had a bit of bread and butter,

my way home.

Q datin §mistress

OALL me not, love, unkind,
That from the nunnerie

Of thy chaste heart and quiet mind,
To war and arms I flie.

Another mistress hence Ι chace,
The first foe in the field,
And with a stronger saith embrace

A sword‚ a horse, a shield.
Lovelace.

OEu au mitat.

So rude and senseless are thy lays,
The weary audience vows‚

'Tis not the Arcadian swain that sings,
But 'tis his herd that lows.

Shenstone.
