ARUNDINES CAMI.

m...- ›mm- ν. mm,-

Then ah ἱ at length, stem Power, forbear,
Thy wrath at length forego:
Enough my youth has felt of eare3

Enough has tasted woe.

Or if ordained by stubborn fate
To drag the eternal chain,
Doomed, as I bend beneath its weight,

Το court relief in vain3

To Mira equal toil impart3
On her thy pang bestow3

Thrill with Love's agony her beart,
And bid her suffer too.

Wrangham.

THREE wise men of Gotham

Went to sea in a bow13
And if the bowl had been stronger

My song had been longer.
