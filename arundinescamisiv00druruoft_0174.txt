ARUNDINES CAMI.

finita.

anv first the Siren Beauty'e face
My wandering eye surveyed‚
Unmoved I saw each fraudful grace,

That round th' enchantrese played:

And still, with careless mien elate,
Defied the Paphian's wile;

As ambushed in a look he sate,
Or couched beneath a smile.

And still to rove I madly vowed
Along the dangerous way,

Secure, where other boasters bowed
Before the tyrant's sway.

Nor learned my breast to heave the sigh,
Or pour the secret heart3

Tifl Mira from her beamy eye
Despatched th' unerring dart.

‘ Fly‚ fatal shaft‚' with eruel zeal
The eonscious murtheress cried,

‘ And teach yon haughty boy to feel
The anguish due to pride.'

To soothe the soul-subduing pain
Awhile I fondly strove;
But eombated‚ alas! in vain,

The omnipotence of Love.
