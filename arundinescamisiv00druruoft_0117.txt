Q &nug of &ineptum

Smo a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye:
Four and twenty blackbirds

'Baked in a pie:

When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing;
Was not that a dainty dish
To set before the King3

The King was in the parlour
Oounting out his money;
The Queen was in the chamber
Eating bread and honey3
The maid was in the garden
Hanging out the clothes:

Down came a little bird

And carried off her nose.
G. G.

Huic tumido loculo massa secalis inest:

Sex quater in patina merularum corpora, crustum
Queis superimpositum pista farina fuit,

Procubuere simul: sed quando adaperta farina est,
Concordes merulis insonuere modi:

Mirum opus harmoniae l—-nonne inter fercula posset
Haec vel regificae lanx placuisse gulae?

Rex erat in camera, numerans sibi pondera nummi,
Pondera plebeio non numeranda viro:
