ARUNDINES CAMI.

Amat aut( wopa}

Fun, oft does Mat with Topaz dine,
Eateth French meat and drinketh wine:
But Topaz his own verse rehearseth,

And Mat must praise what Topaz verseth.

Now sure as saint did e'er shrive sinner‚

Fun hardly earneth Mat his dinner!

Prior.

A THING slipt idly from me: you must guess it.
- Shakspeare.

Ξὲρίηκ ffliux.

H1Nx, Minx! the old witch winkS‚
The fat begins to fry:

There's nobody at home but jumping J oan,
And father, mother, and I !
