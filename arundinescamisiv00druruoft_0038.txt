2 WHEN first, beloved, in vanished hourS,
ᾗ The Blind Man sought thy hand to gain,
² They said thy che-ek was ⁴ bright as flowers

N ew freshened by the summer's rain.
The beauty which made 1116111 rejoice

My darkened eyes might never see, Ι
Β111 well I knew thy gentle voice,

And that was all in all to me.

At length, as years rolled swiftly on,

1 They talked 1ο 1116 of Time's decay,

1 Of roses from thy soft cheek gone,

ι Of ebon tresses turned to grey.

1 Ι heard them3 but I heeded not3

Ι The withering change I could not see;
Thy voice still cheered my darkened lot,
¹ And that was all in all to me.

η And still, beloved, till life grows cold‚

Α We'll wander 'neath the genia! sky,

ᾗ And only know that we are 01d

} ξ By counting happy hours gone by.

2 ὗ Thy cheek may lose its ¹ blushing hue,

ἕ Thy brow less beautiful may be;

But oh the voice, which first I knew,
still keeps 1116 same sweet tone to me 2
