ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEbeit &rubea α’ sinent morth.

Tama groves o' sweet myrtle let foreign lands reekon,
WVhere bright beaming summere exalt the persume3

Far dearer to me yon lone glen o' green breckan,
Wi' the burn stealing under the lang yellow broom.

= Far dearer to me are yon humble broom bowerS‚

Where the blue-bell and gowan lurk lowly unseen;

= Ι For there lightly tripping amang the wild flowerS,

A-listening the limet, ast wanders my J ean.

Though rich is the breeze in their gay sunny valleyS‚
¹ And cold Galedonia's blast on the wave3

Their sweet-scented woodlands that skirt the proud palaee,
What are they Z—the haunt of the tyrant and slave. ἂ

The slave's epicy forests and gold-bubbling fountains
The brave Caledonian views with disdain3
He wanders as free as the winds of his mountains—

Save love's willing fetters, the chains o' his J ean.
Burns.

, BARNABY BRIGHT he was a sharp cur;

³ He would make a great noise if a mouse did but stir3
But now he's grown old and ean no longer bark, Ι
He's condemned by the parson to be hung by the clerk.

Gammer Gurton.
