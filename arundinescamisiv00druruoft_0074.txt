ARUNDINES CAMI.

η ¹ &mm Eth'u.
Ξ SWEET Eeho, sweetest nymph, that livest unseen
Within thy aery shell, v
By slow Meander's margent green,

And in the violet-embroidered (vale,

Where the love-loru nightingale

Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well ε’

Ganst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
That likest thy Narcissus are?
O'! if thou have

Hid them in some flowery eave,

Tell me but where,
Sweet queen of parley, daughter of the sphere Ξ
So may'st thou be translated to the skies‚

And give resounding grace to all heaven's harmonias.

Milton.
