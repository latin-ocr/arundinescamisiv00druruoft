ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEu the meana.

THAT union of the soul and body here,

Which heaven has ordered, calls for several treatment
To suit its several parts—Our outward man

Asks oheerful exereise3 our inward man

Must have his pauses too from serious thought,

And gathers- vigour for his loftier flights

By earthly relaxation-Yet, my friend,

We must not hover here, nor skim the turs
Uninterruptedly, but imP our wings

For rocks aerial ⁴and for upper day.
