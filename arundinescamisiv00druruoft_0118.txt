{Fon they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl' d

„ 3⁵ Where they smile 111 secret, looking over wasted lande,
Ξ Β118111 611(1 famine, plag-ue and earthquake‚ roaring deeps and

But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song
Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,
ἕ Like a tale of little meaning though the words are strong;
Ghanted from an ill-used 1666 of men that eleave the soil,
Ἰ Sow the seed and reap the harvest with enduring toil,
Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine 611(1 oil;
ἰ Τ111 they perish‚ and they suffer—some 'tis whispered—down

'in hell
. ‘ suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian vaneys dweu,

Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.

Tennyson.
