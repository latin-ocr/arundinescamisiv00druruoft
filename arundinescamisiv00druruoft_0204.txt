ARUNDINES CAMI.

‘ Sm, will you please to walk before ζ’

‘ No pray‚ Sir, you are next the door ε’

‘ Upon my honour, I'll not stir'—

‘ Sir, I'm at home—-consider, Sir Γ

‘ Exouse me Sir, I'll not go first ε’

‘ Well if I must be rude, I must—-

But yet I wish I could evade it;

'Tis strangely clownish—-be persuaded?
ΘΟ forward cits—-go forward squires;

Nor scruple each what each admireS.

Life squares not, friendS, with your proceeding,

It flies while you display your breeding:

Such breeding as one's grannam preacheS,

Or some „old daneing master teaches,

Ο for some rude tumultuous follow,

Half crazy, or at least half mellow,

To come behind you unawares

And fairly kiok you both down stairs!
But, Death's at hand—let me advise ye‚

Go forward, friends, or he'll surprise ye.

Tum was an old woman lived under a hill, Α

And if she's not gone, she lives there still,
Gammer sutton. ‚
