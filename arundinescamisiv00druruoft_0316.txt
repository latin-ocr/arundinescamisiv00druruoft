Epitapb nn an {infant

Ean sin could blight or sorrow fade,
Death came with friendly care,

The opening bud to Heav'n conveyeds
And bade it blossom there.

Donne.

ilfizalm xxiii.

MY Shepherd is the living Lord,
Ι therefore, nothing need; ,
In pastures fair, near pleasant streams,

He setteth me to seed.

He shall convert and glad my soul,

Ρ And bring my mind in frame‚

To walk in paths of righteousnesS‚
For His most holy name.

YeS‚ though I walk the vale of Death,
Yet will I sear no ill;

Thy rod and staff they comfort me,
And Thou art with me still.

And in the presence of my foes
My table Thou hast spread,

Thou wilt fill full my· cup, and Thou
Anointed hast my head.

Through all my life Thy favour is
So frankly shewn to me,

That in Thy house for evermore
My dvvelling place shall be.

Sternhold and Hopkins.
