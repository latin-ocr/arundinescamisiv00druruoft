ξ If any hopes thy bosom share
ξ But those which Love has planted there,
Or any cares but his thy breast enthraL
Thou never yet his power hast known:
Love sits 011 a despotia throne,

And reigns a tyram, if he reigns at all.

Now if thou art so lost a thing,
Hither thy tender sorrows bring,

And prove whose patience longest can endure:
We'll strive whose fancy shall be tost ψ
111 dreams of fondest passion most—

For if thou thus hast loved‚ oh never hope a eure !

LITTLE Jack Horner
Sat in a corner
Eating a Christmas pie:
He put in his thumb
And pulled out a plum,
And eried, ‘ What a good boy am Ι !'
