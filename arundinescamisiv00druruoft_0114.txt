NOTHING is here for tears, nothing to wail,

Or knoek the breast3 no weakness, no contempt,
Dispraise or blame; nothing but well and fair,

And what may quiet us in a death so noble.

Let us go find the body, where it lies ‚
Soaked in his enemies' blood3 and from the stream
With lavers pure and cleansing herbs wash off

The clotted gore. I, with what speed the while

(Gaza is not in plight to say us nay)

Will send for all my kindred‚ all my friendS‚

To feteh him hence and solemnly attend

With silent obsequy and funeral train

Home to, his father's house. There will I build him
A monument, and plant it round with shade

Of laurel ever green, and branching palm

With all his trophies hung, and acts enrolled

In copious legend or sweet lyrio song.

Thither shall all the valiant youth reson,

And from his memory inflame their breast

To matchless valour and adventures high:

The virgins also shall on feastful days

visit his tomb with flowers, only bewailing

His lot unfortunate in nuptial choioe‚ ἓ

From whence captivity and loss. of eyes, q
Muton.
