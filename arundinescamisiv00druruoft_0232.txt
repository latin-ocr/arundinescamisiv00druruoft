SAYS Richard to Thomas—and seemed half afraid—
‘ I'm thinking to marry my mistress's maid.
Now because Mrs Lucy to thee is well known,
I'll do't if thou bid'st me, or let it alone.
Now don't make a jest on't3 'tis no jest to me,
In faith I'm in earnest, so prithee be free.
I have no fault to find with the girl since I knew her,
But I'd have thy advice ere I tie myself to her?

Saye Thomas to Richard—-‘ To speak my opinion,
There's not such a brute in king George's dominion3

’ And I firmly believe, if you knew her as I (lo,
v Thou would'st ohoose out a whipping post first to be ,
tied to,

She's peevish, she's thievish, she's ugly, she's old,
And a liar and a fool and a slut and a scold.'

N ext day Richard hastened to Ghuroh and was- wed,
And at night had informed her all Thomas had said.

LITTLE boy Bluet‚ come blow me your horn,
The oow's in the meadow‚ the sheep· in the corn:
But where is the little boy tending his sheep?

He's under the hay-oook fast asleep. ’
Gammer Gurton.
