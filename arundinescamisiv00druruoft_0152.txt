THE north-wind doth blow‚

And we shall have snow,

And what will poor Robin do then,
Poor thing?

He’ll sit in a barn,

And keep himself warm‚

And hide his head under his wing‚
Poor thing.

Bmom) the child, by nature's kindly law,
Pleased with a ratde, tickled with a straW.
A liveliery play-thing gives his youth delight‚
A little louder, but as empty quite.

Gom, garterS, scarfS, amuse his riper stage,
And< beads and prayer books are the toys of age;
Pleased with this bauble still, as that before3

Till tired he sleePS‚ and life's dull play is o'er. >

So I do, master, as fast as I can.

Pat it and prick it and mark it with G,
Then it will serve for Charley and me. ¹
