ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEhe aehtuhhtty,

ΟΗ 2 happy shades——to me unblest ἱ
Friendly to peace, but not to me f

How ill the scene that offers rest,
And hearts that cannot rest, agree!

This glassy stream, that spreading pine,
Those alders quivering to the breeze‚
Might soothe a soul less hurt than mine,
And please, if anything could please.

But fixed unalterable Care

Forgoes not what she feels within,
Shews the same sadness every where,
And slights the season and the scene.

For all that pleased in wood or lawn,

While peace possessed those silent bowers
Her animating smile withdrawn,
Has lost its beauties and its powers.

The saint or moralist should tread
This moss grown alley musing, slow;
They seek like me the secret shade,
But not like me to nourish woe!

Me fruitful scenes and prospects waste
Alike' admonish not to roam3

These tell me of enjoyments past,
And those of sorrows yet to come. ¹

Cowper.
