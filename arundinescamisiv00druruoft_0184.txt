- ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEu mista ‘flammata

LAWRENOE‚ of virtuous father virtuous son,

Now that the fields are dank, and ways all mire,
Where shall we sometimes meet and by the fire
Help waste a sullen day, what may be won
From the hard season gaining? Time will run
On smoother„ till Favonius re-inspire

The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attii-e

The lily and rose, that neither sowed nor spun.
What neat repast shall feast uS‚ light and choice‚

Of Attic taste with wine, whence we may rise
To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice V

Warble' immortal notes and Tuscan air?

He, who of these delights can judge and spare

To interpose them oft, is not unwise.
Milton.
