ARUNDI NES CAM 1.

qeitt.

ANn thou, blest star of Europe's darkest honr,
Whose words were wisdom, and whose oounsels power,
Whom earth applauded through her peopled shore83

Alas! whom earth too early lost deplores:

Ἴ Young without sollieS, without rashness bold,
And greatly poor amidst a nation's gold;

In every veering gale of faotion true,
Untarnished Chatham's genuine child, adieu!
Unlike our common sune, whose gradual ray

Expands from twilight to intenser day,

“ Thy blaze broke forth at once in full meridian sway.

Ο proved in danger! not the fieroest flame
Of discord's rage thy constant sou] could tame;

Not when, far-striding o'er thy palsied land,

Gigantic treason took his holder stand;

Not when wild zeal‚ by murderous faction led,

On Wieklow's hille her grass-green banner spread3
Or those stern conquerors of the restless wave
Defied the native soil they wont to save.—
Undaunted Patriot! in that dreadful bour,

When pride and genius own a stronger power; ,
When the dimmed eyeball and the struggling breaffi,

And pain and terror mark advancing death; ⁷
