HAIL meek eyed maiden, clad in sober grey,
Whose soft approach the weary woodman loves3
As homeward bent to kiss his prattling babes,
J ocund he whistles through the twilight groveS.

When Phoebus sinks behind the gilded hills,
You lightly o'er the misty meadows walk3

The drooping daisies bathe in honey dews,
And nurse the nodding violet's tendet stalk.

The panting Dryads that in day's fierce heat
To inmost bowers and cooling caverns ran,
Return to trip in wauton evening dance3

Old Silvan too returns», and laughing Pan.

To the deep wood the elamorous rooks repair,
Light skims the swallow o'er the watery scene3

And from the sheep-cote and fresh fun-owed field
Stout ploughmen meet, to wrestle on the green.

The swain, that artless sings on yonder rock‚
His supping sheep and lengthening shadow spies;
Pleased with the cool, the calm, refreshful -hour, ’

And with hoarse humming of unnumbered flies,
