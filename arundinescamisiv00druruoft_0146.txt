Ο Mo'rHER Ida, many-fountained Ida„
Dear mother Ida, harken ere Ι die.
I waited underneath the darvmng hius,

Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark‚

And dewy-dark alost the mountain-pine3
Beautiful PariS‚ evil-hearted Pane, Ι
Leading a jet-blaok goat, white-horned, white-hooved,
Came up from reedy Simois all alone.

Ο mother Ida, harken ere I die.
Far-off the torrent called me from the· cleft3
Far-up the >solitary morning smote
The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes
I sat alone: white-breasted like a star
Fronting the dawn he moved: a leopard skin
Drooped from his shoulder, but his sunny hair
Olustered about his temples like a* God's:
And his oheek brightened as the foam-bow brightens 11
When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart ’
Went forth to embraoe him coming ere he came. 11

Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

   

He smiled‚ and opening out his milk-white palm,
Disolos'd a fruit of pure 'Hesperian gold,
That smelt ambrosially‚ and while I looked
And listened, the full-flowing river of speech
