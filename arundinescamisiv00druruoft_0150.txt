ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEittumztante.

Two children in two neighbouring vanges
’, Playing mad pranks along the heasthy leas;
ι ¹ Two strangers meeting at a *festivah
¹ Α Two lovers whispering by an orchard wall3

ἰ Two lives bound fast in 0116 with golden ease3

Two graves grass-grown, beside a grey church tower3
ἶ wash'd with stin mins, and daisy-blossomed;

Ξ Two children in one hamlet born and bred;

¹ Fill up the round of life from hour to hour.

Tennyson.
