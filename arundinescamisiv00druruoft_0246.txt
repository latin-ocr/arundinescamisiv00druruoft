OEht afiarta! uf 50st §John smum.

Nor a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his eorse to the ramparts we hurried;

Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot,

O'er the grave where our hero we buried.

We buried him darkly at dead of night,
The sod with our bayonets turning,

By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,
And the lanthorn dimly burning.

No useless coffin enclosed his breast,

Nor in sheet or in shroud we wound him,

But he lay like a warrior taking his rest
With his martial oloak around him.

Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow3

But we stedfastly gazed on the face of the dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.

We thought as we hollowed 'his narrow bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow‚

That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,

And we far away on the billow!
