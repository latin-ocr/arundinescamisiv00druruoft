ARUNDINES CAMI.

{Bmgtzzs uf {anem

Tmm the voice, the dance obey‚
Tempered to thy wal-bled lay.
O'er Idalia's velvet green

The rosy-crowned Loves are seen,
On Cytherea's day,

With antio sports and blue-eyed PleasureS.
Frisking light in frolic measures;
Now pursuing, now retreating,
Now in circling troops they meet:
To brisk notes in cadence beating
Glauce their many-twinkling feet.

Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare: ¹
Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay:

With arms sublime that. float upon the air,

In gliding state she wins her easy way:

O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move

The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love. ξ

Gray.
