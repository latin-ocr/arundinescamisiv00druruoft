OEhz wan 3302.

Goon people all of every sort
Grive ear unto my song ';

And if you find it wondrous short,
It cannot hold you long.

In Islington there lived a man
Of whom the world might say,

That still a godly -raoe he ran,
Whene'er he went to pray.

A kind and gentle heart he had
To comfort friends and foes ;.

The naked every day he clad,
When he put on his clothes,

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,
Both mongrel, puppy‚ whelp, and hound,

And curs of low degree.

The dog and man at first were ffiends·;

But when a pique began,
The dog to gain his private ends
Went mad, and bit the man.
