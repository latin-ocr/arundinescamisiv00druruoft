112 ARUNDINES CAMI.

You fly, invoke the godsss then turning stop “
To rail; she singing still whirls on her mop.
Not yet the dust had shunned th' unequal strife‚
But, aided by the wind, fought still for life.

Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down,

Threatening with deluge this devoted town:
To shops in erowds the daggled females fly,

Pretend to eheapen 800118, but nothing buy.

The templar spruee, while every spout's abroaeh‚
Stays till 'tis fair, yet seems to eall a eoaeh.
The tucked-up semstress walks with hasty strideS,
While streame run down her oiled umbrella's sides.
Here various kinds by various fortunes led,
Commence 'acquaintance underneath a shed :-
Triumphant tories and desponding whigs

Forget their feuds‚ and join to save their wigs.
Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits,

While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits;
And ever and anon with frightful din

The leather sounds; he trembles from within.

Now from all parts the swelling kennels Ηονν,
And bear their trophies with them as they go:
Filths of all hues and odour seem to tell
What street they sailed from, by their sight and smell.
