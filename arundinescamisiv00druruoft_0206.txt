ARUN DIN Es CAMI.

LATELY on yonder swelling bush‚

Big with many a coming rose,
This early bud began to blush,

And did but half itself disclose:
I plucked it, though no better grown;
And now you see how full 'tis blown.

Still as I did the leaves inspire‚

With such a purple light they 5110115,
Α5 if they had been made of fire,

And spreading 5ο would flame anon.
Al] that was meant by air and sun
To the young flower, my breath has done.

If our loose breath so much ean do,
What may the 531115 in forms of love,
Of purest love and music too,
When Flavia it aspires to move?

When that, which lifeless buds persuades
To wax more soft, her youth invades?

ᾖα altam.

I novun thee beautiful and kind,
And plighted an eternal vow:
So altered are thy face and mind,

'Twere perjury to love thee now,
Pnor.
