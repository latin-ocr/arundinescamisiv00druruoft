Ι He thought I was a ghost, mother, for I was all in white,

ἑ And I ran by him without speaking, like a flash of light.

Ι l They eall me eruel-hearted, but I care not what they say,

For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
’ 'o' the May. i

· They say he's dying all for love, but that ean never be:
y They say his heart is breaking, mother—what is that to me?

’ There's many a bolder lad 'ill woo me any summer day,
1 And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen ξ

Ι o' the May.

Ξ Little Effie shall go with me to-morrow to the green,
ξ And you'll be there too, mother, to see me made the Queen3 ξ’
l For the shepherd lads on every side 'ill come from far away, θ
And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen

o' the May.

And by the meadow-trenehes blow the faint sweet euekoo—

And the wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in swamps and
Ι hollows gray,
And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
o' the May.
