ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEbe {iales of effrene.

THE isles of Greece, the isles of Greece,
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,

Where ⁴grew the arts of war and peace,
Where Delos rose and- Phoebus sprung!

Eternal summer gilds them yet,
But all, except their sun, is set.

The mountains look on Marathon,
And Marathon looks on the sea3
And musing there an hour alone,
I dreamed that Greece might still be free:
For standing on the Persian's grave,
I could not deem myself a slave.

A king sate on the rocky brow
Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;

And ships by thousands lay below,
And men in natione—all were hie!

He counted them* at break of day—-
And when the sun set—where were they?

Byron.

&bt that libro in a aehot.

THERR was an old woman who lived in a shoe3
She had so many children she didn't know what to do.
She gave them some broth without any bread,

’ 3 Then‘ whipt them all soundly and sent them to bed.

Gammer Gurton.
