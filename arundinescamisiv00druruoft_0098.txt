ARUNDINES CAMI.

 

<atoma-z.

Two such I saw, what time the labour⁸d ox

In his loose traces from the furrow came,

And the swink'd hedger at his supper sat3 Ι
I saw them under a green mantling vine, Ξ
That crawls along the side of yon small hill,
Plueking ripe clusters from the tender shoots}

Their port was more than human as they stood:

I took it for a fairy vision

Of sothe gay creatures of the dement, 3 ⁷
That in the colours of the rainbow live, Ξ
And play i' the plighted clouds. Ι was avve-struck,
And as I past, I worshipt; if those you seek‚ 3
It were a journey like the path to H eaven Ξ

To help you find them. . Ξ —
