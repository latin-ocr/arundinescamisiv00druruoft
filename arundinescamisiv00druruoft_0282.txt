ARUNDINES CAMI.

It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the Lord.
l Kings xiii. 26.

Pnopnm of God, arise and take

With thee the words of wrath divine,
The scourge of heaven, to shake
O'er yon apostate shrine.

Where angele down the lueid stair
Came hovering to our sainted sires»,

Now in the twilight glare
The heathen's wizard fireS.

Go, with thy voice the altar rend ;”
Seatter the ashes3 be the arm,
That idols would befriend,

Shrunk at thy withering oharm!

Then turn thee, for thy time is short,
But traee not o'er the former way,

Lest idol pleasures court
Thy heedless soul astray.

Thou know'st how hard to hurry by,
Where on the lonely woodland road
Beneath the moonlight sky
The festal warblings flowed;

Where maidens to the Queen of Heaven
Wove the gay dance round oak or palm,
Or breat-hed their vows at even

In hymns as soft as balm.
