ARUNDINES CAMI.

The unwearied sun from day to ,day
Does his Creator's praise display,

And publishes to every land
The work of an Almighty hand.

Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale,

And nightly to the listening earth
Repeats the story of her birth:

While all the stars that round her burn,
And all the planets in their turn,

Confirm the tidings as they roll‚' Ἴ
And. spread the truth from pole to pole.

What though 'in solemn silence all

Move round 'the dark terrestria] hall?
What though nor voice nor minstrel sound
Among their radiant orbs be found?

With saints and angels they rejoice,
And utter forth a glorious voice,
For ever singing as they shine‚

“ The hand that made us is divine.''
Addison.
