ARUNDINES CAM 1.

‘OEbt jffllan in the mmmmm.

ΤΗΕ man in· the wilderness asked me,
‘ How many strawberries grow in the sea 3⁹

I answered him, as I thought good,

‘ As many as red herrings grew in the wood.'

’πίω &mmmm uf vanna.

THE current, that with gentle murmur glides,
Thou know'st being stopped, impatiently doth rage z
But when -his fair course is not hindered,

He makes sweet music with the enamelled stoneS‚
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge

He overtaketh in his '‘pilgrimage3

And so by many winding nooks he strays

With willing spol-t to the wild ocean.

Then let me ge, and hinder not my course3

I'll be as patient as a gentle stream,

And make a pastime of each weary step,

Till the last step have brought me to my love;
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil

A blessed soul doth in Elysium. ,
shakspeare.
