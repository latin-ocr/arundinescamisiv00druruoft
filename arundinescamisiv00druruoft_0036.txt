ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEhe ‘statos 3Eaters.

BRANCHES they bore of that enchanted stem,

Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave

To each: but whoso did receive of them

And 16616, 10 him the gushing of the wave .

Far far away did seem to mourn and rave

On alien shores3 and if his fellow spake,

His voice was 111111, 66 voices from the grave3

And deep-asleep he seemed, yet all awake;

And music in his ears 1116 beating heart did wake.
They sat 1116111 down upon the yellow sand,

Between the sun and moon, upon the shore;

And sweet it was 10 dream of Father-land,

And wife and child and slave; but evermore

Most weary seemed the sea, weary the oar,

Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.

Then some one said, ⁶ We will return no more ς’·-

And all 61 01166 they sang, ⁶ 0111· island home

‘ Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam.'
