How are thy servants blest, Ο Lord‚
How sure is their defence3

Eternal Wisdom, is their guide,
Their help Omnipotenee.

In distant lands and realms remoteJ

— Supported by thy care,

Through burning elimes I passed unhurt,
And breathed in' tainted air.

Thy merey sweetened every toil,
Made every region please;

The hoary Alpine hills it warmed‚

And smoothed the Tyrrhene seaS.

‘ L1vn while ' you live‚' the Epicure will say,

‘ And give to pleasure every fleeting day ε’

‘ Live while you live‚' the sacred Preaeher erieS,
⁶ And give to Grod each moment as it flies.'—
Lord‚ in my life let both united be;

Ι live to pleasure‚ while Ι live to Thee. ἶ , ,
