ARUNDINES CAMI.

&uun fftffiap.

BouNn upon the accursed tree,
Faint and bleeding, who ἰειΙ He?

By the eyes so pale and dim,

Streaming blood and writhing limb,

By the flesh with scourges torn,

By the crown of twisted thorn,

By the sides so deeply pierced‚

By the baffled burning thirst, ’
By the drooping death-dewed brow—
Sop of Man! 'tis Thou! 'tis Thou!

Bound upon the accursed troo,

Dread and awful, who is He?
By the sun at noonday pale,

Shivering rocks and rending ven,

, By earth that trembles at his doom,
By yonder saints who burst their tomb‚
By Edon„ promised e'er He died

To the selon by his side,

Lord! our suppliant knees we bow—
Son of God! 'tis Thou! 'tis Thou!
