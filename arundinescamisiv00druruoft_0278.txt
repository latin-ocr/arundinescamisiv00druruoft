ARUNDINES CAMI.

{Brnpagatfun of ὼε &uslauk

FnoM Greenland's icy mountainS‚
From India's eoral strand,

Where Afrie's sunny fountains‚

Roll down their golden sand;
From many an ancient river,

From many a palmy plain,
They eall us to deliver

Their land from error's chain.

What though the spicy breezes⁴
Blow soft o'er J ava's isle,
Though every prospect please8‚
'And only man is vile?
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of Grod are strewn,
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone.

Gan we, whose souls are lighted

With wisdom from on high,
Gan we to men benighted‚

The lamp of life deny?
Salvation ἱ oh—-Salvation 2

The joyful sound preclaim3
Tin each remotest nation

Has learnt Messiah's name !
