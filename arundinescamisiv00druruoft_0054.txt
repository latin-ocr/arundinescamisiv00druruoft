‘ My father bless'd me fervently‚

    
 

Yet did not much complain;

   

But sorely will my mother sigh
Till I come back again.'—-

   

“ Enough‚ enough, my little lad!

   

Such tears become thine eye;
If I thy guileless bosom had,
Mine own would not be dry.

      
 
    

“ Come hither‚ hither‚ my staunoh yeoman‚
Why dost thou look so pale?

Or dost thou drea-d a Frenoh foeman‘i'
Or shiver at the gale Y*—

‘ Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
Sir Ohilde, I'm not so weak3

But thinking on an absent wife

Will blaneh a faithful cheek.

      
 
        
  

 

‘ My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
Along the bordering lake,

And when they on their father eall,

What answer shall she make ξ’-

      
    

“ Enough‚ enough, my yeoman good,

   

’ Thy grief let none gainsay3

   

But I, who am of lighter mood,
Will laugh to flee away.
