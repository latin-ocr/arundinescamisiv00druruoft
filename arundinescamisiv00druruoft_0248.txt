ARUNDINES (ΒΑΜ Ι.

Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,
And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him;
But little he'll reek‚ if they'll let him sleep 011, ι

In the grave where a Briton has laid him.

But half of our heavy task was done,
When the clock told the hour of retiring;
And we heard the distant and random gim,
That the foe was sullenly firing.

Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and gory3
We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,
But we left him alone in his glory.

 

Woli'e.

(ΣΒ lap thy lnnf in mine, ’fiam

O LAY thy loof in mine, lass,

In mine, lass; in mine, lass;

And swear on thy white hand, lass,
That thou wilt be my ain.

A slave to love's unbounded sway,

He ast has wrought me meikle wate,

But now he is my deadly fae,
Unless thou be my ain.

There's mony a lass has broke my rest, ’

That for a blink I ha' loved best:

But thou art queen within my breast‚
For ever to remain.

Eurus.
