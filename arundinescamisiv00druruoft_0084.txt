GruAEs Oollins he said to his old mother,
Mother‚ come bind up my head,

And send to the parson of our parish‚
For to morrow I shall be* dead, dead,
For to-morrow I shall be dead.

His mother she made him some water-gruel,
And stirred it round with a spoon;
Giles Oollins he ate up ‚his water-gruel,

And died before 'twas noon, 'noon‚

And died before 'twas noon.

Lady Anna was sitting at her windOW,
Mending her night-robe and coif ;

She saw the very prettiest col-pse,
She had seen in all her life, life,
She had seen in all her life.

What bear ye there, ye six strong men,
Upon your shoulders so hith

We bear the body of Griles Gellius,
Who for love of you did die, die.
Who for love of you did die.

Set him down ! set him down ! Lady Anna she (tried,
On the grass that grows so green3

To-morrow before the clock strikes ten, ί
My body shall lie by his'n‚ by his'n, ’ f
My body shall lie by his'n.
