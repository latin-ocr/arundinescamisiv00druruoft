’ Nomai friend ! say where moy Freedom banish'd,

      

Where may stricken Peace a refuge find,

Now the century in storm has vanished‚

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
    

And the next in carnage stalks behind?
All old bonds of nations rent asunder3
All old forms swift hastening to decline3
ι Nor ean Ocean stay the battle's thunder,
’ Nor the Nile-Gai, nor the ancient Rhine.
Two gigantic rival states, contending
For the sole dominion of the world,
O'er all laws, all birthrights else, impmding,
Have the trident and the lightning hurl'd.

Every land to them must mete its treasure3

And, like Brennus in those ruder dayS‚

Here the Frank his ponderous falchion's measure
In the wavering scale of justice lays;

There his fleets the Briton, rich and mighty,
Polypus-like⁷ stretches o'er the deep,

And the kingdom of free Amphitrite,

Gloses as his own peculiar keep. 1

To the South—pole⁹s hidden constellations
