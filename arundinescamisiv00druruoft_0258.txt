ARUNDINES CAMI.

{Rama wstffle mauult,

ΟΜ) Mother Widdle Waddle jumpt out of bed,
And out at the casement she popt her head,
Grying—-‘ The house is on fire, the grey goose is dead !

And the fox he is come to the town, oh Γ
Gammer Gurton.

WELL, be it so, my friend !—I've done
With mirth, extravagance, and fun:

I sear I've passed the fatal line:

That uneheeked mirth and unstopped wine,
That flow of wit that knows no bound,
The merry laugh's perpetual round,

Nay, e'en the soeial generous glow

That all-enlivening grapes bestow—

J oys that a few brief sennights past

I thought eternally would last,

Or fondly wished, before they fied,

I might be numbered with the dead—

No more are tricked with charms for me,

Nor wake my soul to jollity:
