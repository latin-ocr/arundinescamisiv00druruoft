ARUNDINES CAMI.

'Tis past, 'tis past—-but I gaze on it now
With aehing heart and throbbing brow:

'Twas there she nursed me, and there she died:
And memory fiows with a lava tide.

Say it is folly and deem me weak,
Whilst the sealding drops roll down my eheek3

But I love it, I love it, and cannot tear

My soul from my Mother's old Arm-Chair.

E. Cooke.

THERE was a man of Thessaly,
And he was wondrous wise;

He jumped into a gooseberry bush
And scratehed out both his eyes:

And when he saw his eyes were out,

With all his might and main

He jumped into another bush—

And seratehed them in again.
