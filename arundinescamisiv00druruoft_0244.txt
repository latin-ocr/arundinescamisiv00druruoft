ARUNDINES CAMI.

maloth.

MY sentence is for open war: of wiles

More unexpert I boast not; them let those
Oontrive who need, or when they need, not novv.
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,
Millions that stand in arms and longing wait
The signal to ascend, sit lingering here
Heaven's fugitives», and for their dwelling-place
Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame‚

The prison of his tyranny, who reigns

By our delay3 No, let us rather choose,
Armed with hell flames and fury, all at once,
O'er heaven's high towers to force resistless way,
Turning our tortures into horrid arms

Against the torturer; when to meet the noise
Of his almighty engine he shall hear

Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see

Black fire and horror shot with* equal rage

Among his angeIS, and his throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur, and strange fire,

His own invented tormentS.
Milton.
