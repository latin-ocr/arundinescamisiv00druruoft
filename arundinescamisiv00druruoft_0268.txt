ΙΝ the hour of my distreSS,
When temptations sore oppress,
And when I my sins confess—
Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When Ι lie within my bed,
Sick in heart and sick in head,
And with doubts discomfited—

Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When the house doth sigh and weep,
And the world, is drowned in sleep,
Yet mine eyes their vigils keep—⁴

Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When the passing bell doth toll,
And the furies in a shoal
Oome to fright my parting soul—
Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When the tapers all burn blue,
When the comforters are few,
And that number more than true—

Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When the priest his last has prayed‚
And Ι nod to what is said,

'Gause my speech is now decayed—
Sweet Spirit, comfort me!
