ARUNDINES CAMI.

Turn, Christian, turn! thy soul apply
To truths divinely given;

The bones that underneath thee lie
Shall live for hell or heaven!

Μ

OEbe Eun.

To die is landing on some silent shore,

Where billows never break nor tempests roar:
Ere well we feel the friendly stroke, 'tis o'er.
The wise, through thought, the insults of death defy,

The fools through blessed insensibility.

'Tis what the guilty sear, the pious orave,

Sought hy the wreteh, and vanquished by the brave;
It eases lovere, sets the captive free,

And though a tyrant, offers libertyss

Garth.

On most mereiful,
Oh most bountiful,
God -the Father Almighty!
By the Redeemer's
Sweet intercession, η ’
Hear uS, hear uS, when we cry!

Heber.
