QBh nu me nabet mention ber.

ΟΗ no: we never mention Her!
Her name ἰ8 never heard:

My lips are now. forbid to speak
That once—familiar word.

From sport to sport they hurry me,
To banish my regret; ’

And when they win a smile from me,
They think that I forget.

They bid me seek in change of scene
The oharmS‚ that others 866;

But, were I in a foreign land,
They'd find no change in me. ὓ

v 'Tis true, that I behold no more

 

 

The valley where we met;
The hawthorn-tree no more Ι 866-
But how can I forget?

They tell me, she is happy now,
The gayest of the gay;

They say, that she forgets me—but
I heed not what they say3

Like me, perhaps she struggles with
anh feeling of regret:

But, if she loved as I have loved,

She never can forget.
