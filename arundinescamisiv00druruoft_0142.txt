ARUNDINES CAMI.

&tubum

Am> now from their fountains
In Enna's mountains

Down one vale where the morning basks,
Like friends once parted
Grown single-hearted,

They ply their watery tasks,
At sun-rise they leap
From their cradles steep

In the curve of the shelving hill;
At noontide they flow
Through the woods below,

And the meadows of Asphodel;
And at night they sleep .
In the rooking deep,

Beneath the Ortygian shore;
Like spirit-s that lie
In the azure sky,

When they love but live no more,

OEbe chnmu’z asseplp.

’ J orm Tnorr was desired by two witty peers
To tell them the reason, why Asses had ears:

ι An't please you', quoth John, ‘ I'm not given to letters,
Nor dare I pretend to know more than my betters;
Howe'er from this time Ι shall ne'er see your graceS,

As I hope to be saved, without thinking of Asses?
Goldsmith.
