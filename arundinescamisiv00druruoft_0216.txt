ARUNDINES CAMI.

Now every passion sleeps; desponding Love‚
And pining Envy, ever-restless Pride3

A holy calm creeps o'er my peaceful soul,
Anger and mad Ambition's storms subside.

Ο modest Evening! oft let me appear

A wandering votary in thy pensive train;
Listening to every wildly-warbling throat‚

That fills with farewell sweet thy darkening plain.

ΙΝ garret high, choked up with books,

Worn in his garments as his lookS,
Lanker in limb than dustman's shovel‚
But well· to do in self approval,
A Scholar sat, above the crowd,
And thus soliloquised aloud.
‘ Ο heaven-sent precept Ξ happy chance,
That shamed me of my ignorance,
Laid useless science on the shelf‚
And bid me only KNow MYSELF !
O noble toil with triumph crowned,
Deep truth in deeper study found !
How long in silence have I been
The cleverest, sweetest‚ best of men!
Let me display myself unfurled
To the profoundly nescient world.
The secret of all knowledge is to show it—

He only KNoWS, whom people know to know it?
