ARUNDINES CAM Ι.

How say you? we have slept‚ my lords.
My heard has grown into my lap Γ

The barons swore with many words),
'Twas but an after-dinner nap.

‘ Pardy,' returned the king, ‘ but still
My joints are something stiff or so,
My Lord, and shall we pass the bill
I mentioned half an hour ago 3⁹
The Ghancellor sedate and vain
In courteous words returned reply;
But dallied with his golden chain,
And, smiling‚ put the question by.

Tennyson.

As I was going up Pippen Hill,
Pippen Hill was dirty,

There I met a pretty Miss,
And she dropt me a curtesy.

Little Miss‚ pretty Miss,
Blessings light upon you!

If I had half a erown in purse,
I'd spend it all upon you.

Gammer Gurton.
