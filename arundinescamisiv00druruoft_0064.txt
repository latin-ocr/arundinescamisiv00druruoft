Eupbelia auh (ablue.

Tm: merchant, to secure his measure,

Conveys it in a borrowed name:

Euphelia serves to grace my measure3
But Chloe is my real flame.

My softest verse, my darling lyre‚
Upon Euphelia's toilet lay;
When Chloe noted her desire,
That I should sing, that Ι should play.

My lyre Ι tune, my voice I mise,

But with *my numbers mix my sighs;

And whilst I sing Euphelia's praise‚
I fix my soul on Chloe's eyes,

Fair Chloe blushed—-Euphelia frowned:
I sung and gazed: I played and trembled:

And Venus to the loves around
Remarked‚ how ill we all dissembled.

With rings on 1161· fingers

And bells 011 1161· 1068,
She shall have music wherever she goes,
