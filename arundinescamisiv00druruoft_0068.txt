ξ Dium< to me only with thine eyeS‚
⁹ And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss within the cup,
And I'll not ask for wine.
The thirst, that from the soul doth spring,
Doth ask a draught divine;
But might I from J ove's nectar sip,

I'd change it not for thine.
Ben Jonson

ἳβίῐῑῃωῑίι.

Ono Pillyeoek sat on a grassy hill,

And if he's not gone, he sits there still.
Gammer (amon,

OEhe fflatkz of ἷιοῇε.

Gom: here, fond youth, whoe'er thou be,
That boast'st to love as well as me,

And if thy breast have felt so wide a wound,
Come hither, and thy flame approve;
1³11 teaeh thee what it is to love,

And by what marks true passion may be found.

It is to be all bathed in team,
Το live upon a smile for yeme,
To lie whole ages at a beauty's feet,
To kneel‚ to languish‚ to implore,
And still, though she disdain‚ adore.
It is to do all this, and think thy sufferings sweet.
