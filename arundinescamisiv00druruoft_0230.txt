ARUN DIN Es CAMI.

The insect youth are on the wing,

Eager to taste the honied spring,
And float amid the liquid noon:

Some lightly o'er the current skim,

Some shew their gaily-gilded trim

Quick glaucing to the sun.

To Contemplation's sober eye

Such is the raee of man:

And they that ereep, and they that fly,

Shall end where they began.

Alike the busy and the gay
But flutter through life's little day,

In fortune's varying colours drest:
Brushed by the hand of rough M ischance,
Or chilled by age, their airy danee

They leave, in dust to rest.

Methinks I hear in aecents low
The sportive kind reply—

Poor moralist! and what art thou?
A solitary fly U!

Thy joys no glittering female meets,
No hive hast thou of boarded sweets,
No painted plumage to display:
On hasty wings thy youth is flown;
Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone—

We frolic while 'tis May.
Gray.
