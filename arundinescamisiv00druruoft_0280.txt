Waft, wast, ye winde, his story,
And you, ye waters, roll,
Till like a sea of glory
It spreads from pole to pole:
Till o'er our ransomed nature,
The Lamb for sinuers elain,
Redeemer‚ King, Creator,

In bliss returns to reign !

Lonn, now lettest thou thy servant depart- in peace,

For mine eyes have seen thy salvation‚
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people3

To be a light to lighten the GentileS‚
And· to be the glory of thy people Israel.

St Luke 11. 29.
