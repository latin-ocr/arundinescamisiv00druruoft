, 3 How often have I blest the coming day,
³ When toil remitting lent its turn to play,
, And all the village train from labour free

 

5 70 ARUNmNEs CAMI.

OEbe ffltsmm village.

’ 3 How often have I paused on every oham,

· ζ The sheltered cot and cultivated farm,

· The never-failing brook and busy mill,

¹ 3 The decent ohuroh that topt the 'neighbouring hill,
, ⁴ The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,
-τ For talking age and whispering lovers made!

. ἱ Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree;

While many a pastime ciroled in the shade‚

The young contending as the old surveyed;

And many a gambol frolieked o'er the ground,

And slights of art and feats of strength went round;
And still as each repeated pleasure tired, χ
Suooeeding sports the mirthful band inspired: ³
The daneing pair that simply sought renown

By holding out to tire each other down;
The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,

While secret laughter tittered round the place3

The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love,
The matron's glance that would those looks reprove!

ζ These were thy eharms‚ sweet Village3 sports like these ζ
ῑ ἑ With sweet succession taught even toil to please3 ᾗ
These round thy bowers their cheerful influenoe shed; 3
> These were thy oharms—but all these charms are fied. ξ
