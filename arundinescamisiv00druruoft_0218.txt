 

ARUNDINES CAMI.

υ OEhe οἰδ ffirmwbair.

I Lovn it, Ι love it, and who shall dare
To chide me for loving that old Arm-Chairss

I've treasured it long as a sainted prize;
, , I've bedewed it with tears and embalmed it with siglis:
. 'Tis bound by a thousand bands to my beart,
Not a tie will break, not a link will start ε
Would ye know the spell Ξ-ε, Mother sat there,
And a sacred thing is that old Arm-Chair.

In ohildhood's hour I lingered near

The hallowed seat with listening ear;

And gentle words that Mother would give

To fit me to die and teaoh me to live.

She told me shame would never betide

With truth to my creed and Grod for my guide;
She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer,

As I knelt beside that old Arm-Chair.

I sat and watched her many a day,

While her eyes grew dim and her looks were grey3
And Ι almost worshipped her- when she smiled,
And turned from the Bible to bless her child.
Years‘ rolled on-—but the last one. sped;

My idol was shattered‚ my earth star fled3

I learnt how much the soul ean bear— .
When I saw her die in the old Arm-Chair.
