Then you show your little light,
Twinkle‚ twinkle, all the night.

Then the traveller in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark:

He could not see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so.

In the dark blue sky you keep,

And often through my eurtains peep3
For you never shut your eye,

Till the Sun is in the sky.

I ‚NE'ER could any lustre see

In eyes that would not look on me;
Ι ne'er saw nectar in a lip,

But where my own did hope to sip.
Has the maid who seeks my heart
Oheeks of rose untouehed by art?

I will own the colour true,

When yielding blushes aid their hue.
Is her hand so soft and pure?

I must press it to be sure3

Nor ean I be certain then,

Till it grateful press again.

Must I with attentive eye

Wateh her anxious bosom sigh3
