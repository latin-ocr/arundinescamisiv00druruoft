ARUNDINES CAMI.

With cedars chosen by his hand
From Lebanon‚ he plants the land:
And makes the hollow seas that roar
Proclaim the ambergrease on shore.
He easts· (whereof we rather boast)
The Gospel pearl upon our coast, ’
And in these rocks for us did frame
A temple where to sound his name.
Ο let our voice his praise exalt

Till it arrive at Heaven's vault;
Which then perhaps rebounding may ’
tho beyond the Mexioan bay.''
Thus sung they in the English boat
A holy and a oheerful note;

And all the way to guide their chime
With falling oars they kept the time,

Ο THAT I was where I would be!
Then would I be where Ι am not:
But where I am I still must be,

And where I would be I cannot.
