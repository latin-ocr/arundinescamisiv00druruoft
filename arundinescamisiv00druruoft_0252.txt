ARUNDINES CAMI.

Before he mounts the hill I know
He eometh quickly: from below

Sweet galeS, as from deep gaudens, blow

Before him, striking on my brow.
In my dry hrain my spirit soon
Down-deepening from swoon to swoon

Faints like a dazzled morning moon.

The wind sounds like a silver wire,
And from beyond the noon a fire
Is pour'd upon the hills, and nigher
The skies stoop down in their desire;
And isled in sudden seas of light,
My heart pierced through with fieroe delight,

Bursts into blossom 'in his sight.

My whole soul waiting silently,
All naked in a sultry sky,
Droops, blinded with his shining eye;
I will possess him, or will die.
I will grow round him in his place,

Grow-—live—-die looking on his face,

Die, dying elasp'd in his embraee.
