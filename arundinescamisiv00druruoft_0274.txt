ARUNDINES CAMI.

Ξῖ iz 312 he not afram.

WHEN I sink down in gloom or sear,
Hope blighted or delayed‚

Thy whisper, Lord, my heart shall cheer‚
“'Tis I: be not afraid! ”

Or startled at some sudden blow,
If fretful thoughts I feel,

“ Fear not, it is but I !'' shall flow‚'
As balm my wound to heal.

Nor will Ι quit thy way, though foes
Some onward pass defend,

For each rough voice the wateh-word gnae,
“Be not afraid !—a friend !''

And Ο t when judgment's trumpet clear
Awakes me from the grave,
Still in its echo may I hear,

“ 'Tis Christ! He comes to save.”
Lyra Apostohca.

WHY sittest thou on yonder sea-girt rock, Ἰ

” With downward look and sadly dreaming eye? ’
Playest thou. beneath with Proteus' flock‘e'
Or with the far bound sea bird dost thou flyss
