 

ARUNDINES CAMI.

m. ⁶„--.,.-.—....-

Old δεξί’.

Ι sit upon this sea-girt rock‚
With downward look and dreaming eye:

But neither do I sport with Proteus' floek‚
Nor with the far bound sea bird would I fly.

I list the splash so chill and clear
Of yon old fisher's solitary oar,

I wateh the waves that rippling still
Ohase one another o'er the marble shore.

N ew δεξί’.

Yet from the splash of yonder oar
No dreamy sounds of sadness come to me:
And yon fresh waves that beat the shore,
How men-ily they splash‚ how merrily!

Old Seff.

I mourn for the delicious dayS‚

When those calm sounds fell on my childish ear,
A stranger yet to the wild ways

Of triumph and mmm-se, of hope and sear.

, Nem sees.

Moumest thou, poor soul, and wouldst thou yet
Gall back the things which shall not, cannot be?
Heaven must be won, not dreamed3 thy task is>set3

Peaoe was not made for earth, nor rest for thee.
Lyra* A‘postohca.
