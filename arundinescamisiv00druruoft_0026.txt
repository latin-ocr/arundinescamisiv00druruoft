 

ARUNDINES CAM Ι.

To all isleS‚ all coasts of furthest natione—
All—but only those of Paradise.

Vainly o'er the world's wide surfaee ranging‚
Would'st thou seek that blessed spot to know,

Where bright Freedom's veidure smiles unchanging, ’

Where life's earliest flowers undying blow3
Endless lies the globe's huge floating mansion,
Searce ean sail its bulk enormous trace—

Yet not all throughout its vast expansion
May ten· happy beings find a place.
To the beart-'s still chamber, deep and lonely‚
Must thou fiee from life's tumultuous throng:
Freedom in the land of dreams is only,
And the Beauteous¹ blooms alone in song.

Tamum was an old man of Tobago,
Who lived 011 rice gruel and sag03

Tin much to his bliss

His physieian said this-
‘ To a leg, Sir, of mutton you may g0.'
