AY, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in oold obstruction‚ and to rot:

This sensible warm motion to become

A kneaded olod3 and the delighted spirit
Το bathe in fiery floodS‚ or to reside

In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice3

To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,

And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those, that lawless and uncertain thoughts

Imagine howling—'tis too horrible !

The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, aohe, penui-y, and imprisonment
Gan lay on nature, is a paradise

To what we sear of death.

Nothing tan tumr uf nothing.

THERE was an old woman called ‘ N othing—at-aJL'
Who rejoiced in a dwelh'ng exceedingly smalh

A man stretched his mouth to its utmost extent,
And down at one gulp house and old woman went.
