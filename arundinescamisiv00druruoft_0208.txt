ARUNDINES GAMI.

OEbe fitst Εῖιτίεῐ.

‘ ΟΗ call my brother back to me,
I cannot play alone:
The summer comes with flower and bec—-

Where is my brother gone?

The butterfly is glaucing bright
Along the sunbeam's track;

I care not now to chase its ssight„—
Ο call my brother back.

The flowers run wild-—the flowers we sowed

Around our garden tree;

Our vine is drooping with its load—
Ο call him back to me Γ

‘ He would not hear my voice, fair child;
He may not come to thee:
The face, that once like spring-time smiled,

On earth no more thou'lt see.

A flower's brief bright life of joy,
Such unto him was given:
(Ξο, thou must play alone, my boy—

Thy brother is in heaven?
