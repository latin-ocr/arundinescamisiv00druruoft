ARUNDINES CAMI. ,

annixa.

THOUGH by a sickly taste betrayed

Some may dispraise the lovely maid,
With fearless pride I say,

That she is healthfuL fleet and strong,

And down the rocks ean leap along

Like rivulets in May.

And smiles has she to earth unknown3

Smiles‚ that with motion of their own
Do spread and sink and rise3

That come and go with endless play,

And ever as they pass away

Are hidden in her eyeS.

She loves her fire, her cottage-home‚
Yet o'er the moorland will she roam

In weather rough and bleak3
And when against the wind she strains‚
Ο might I kiss the mount-ain rains

That sparkle on her eheek!
