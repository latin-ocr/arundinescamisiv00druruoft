108 ARUNDINES CAMI.

Turning again toward childish trebie, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,

Is second ohildishness and mere oblivion,

Sans teeth‚ sans eyes, sans terete, sans everything.
Shakespeare.

waughtet uf {utrina

Vmem daughter of Locrine‚
Sprung of old Anchises' line,
May thy brimmed waves for this
Their full tribute never miss,
’ From a thousand petty rills
That· tumble down the snowy hills:
’ Summer drought or singed air
3Never sooroh thy tresses fair,
Nor wet October's torrent fiood
Δ Thy molten crystal fill with mud:
A May thy billows roll ashore
The beryl and the golden ore;
May thy lofty head be erowned
With many a tower and terraee round,
And here and there, thy banks upon,

With groves of myrrh and cinnamon.
Milton.
