‡ ARUNDINES CAMI.

“A few short hours and He will rise
To give the morrow birth;

And I shall hail the main and skies,
But not my mother earth.

Deserted is my own good hall,
Its hearth is desolate3

Wild weeds are gathering on the wall;
My dog howls at the gate.

‘⁶ Come hither‚ hither, my little page !
Why dost thou weep and wailss

Or dost thou dread the billow's rage,
Or tremble at the gale?

But dash the tear-drop from thine eye3
Our ship is swift and strong:

Our fleetest falcon searee ean fly

More merrily along.''

⁶ Let winds be shrilL let waves roll high,
Ι sear not wave nor wind:

Yet marvel not, Sir Ghilde, that I
Am sorrowful in 1nind;

For I have from my father gone,
A mother whom I love,

And have no friend, save these aione,

But thee—and one above.
