Qut sottum still putent.

Gon find 301116 whispering shade 116316 Arne or Poe,
And gently 'mong their violets throw

Your weary'd limhs, and see if all those faire
Enehantments 0311 011311116 griefe or care.

Our sorrowes still pursue us, 31111 when you
The ruin'd *capitoll shall view

And 31311163, 3 disorder'd heape3 you 0311
Νο1 01116 yet the 11136336 of man,

And banish your owne thoughts, Groe travaile where
Another Sun 31111 3131163 appeare‚

And 131111 1101 10110111 by any eovet-ous' fleet,
And yet even there your selfe youle 1116616.

Stay here then, and while 011110113 exiles find
New toyes for a fantastique mind;

Enjoy 31 1101116 what's reall: here 1116 Spring
By her aeriall quires 110111 sing

As sweetly 10 yon, 33 if you were laid

Vnder the learn'd Thessalian shade.

Habington,

SWANS sing before they die: ⁴ 'twere no bad thing

Should certain persons die before they sing.
