ARUNDINES CAMI.

mount &aiat Zssernath.

WHERE these rude rocks on Bernard's summit nod,
Once heavenwards sprung the throne of Pennine Jove,
An ancient shrine of hospitable Love,

Now burns the altar to the Christian's God.

Here peaceful Piety, age on age, has trod γ
The waste3 still keeps her vigils‚ takes her rest;

still as of yore salutes the coming guest,
And cheers the weary as they onward reve,
Healing each waywom limb—or oft will start

Gatching the storin-lost wanderer's sinking cry,
Speed the rich cordial to his ebbing heart,

Ghafe his stiff limbs and bid him not to die.
So tasked to smooth stern Winter's drifting wing‚

And garb the eternal snows in more eternal spring.

Instead of that a sweet and gentle word;

On our part wanting the abilitieS.
