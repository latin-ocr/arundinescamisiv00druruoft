Wmm: petty offences and felonies eman,
Is there no jurisdiction for stealing a beart?

Yon, fair one, will smile and cry, ‘ LaWS, I defy you ς’

ὲ Assured that no peers can be summon'd to try you !
But think not that paltry defence will secure ye,

' For the Muses and Graees will just make a jury.

GOUGHING in a shady grove
Sat my J uliana3
Lozenges I gave my love

,Ipeeacuanhaz
From the box the imprudent maid
Three scere of them did pick3
Then sighing tenderly‚ she said—
< My Damon, I am sick 2⁹

ΟΝ parent knees a naked new-born child,
Weeping thou sat’st, while all around thee smiled:
So live, that sinking to thy life's last sleep,

Oalm thou may'st smile, while all around thee weep.
