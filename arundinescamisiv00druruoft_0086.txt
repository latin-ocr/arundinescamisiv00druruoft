ARUNDINES CAMI.

Lady Anna was buried in the east,
Giles Collins was buried in the west3
There grew a lily from Giles Oollins
That touched Lady Anna's brenet, breast‚
That touched Lady Anna's breast.

There blew a cold north-easterly wind
And eut this lily in twain,

Which never there was seen before
And it never will again, again,
And it never will again.

Gammer Gurton.

ΕΕᾶΙΙ 1112 thim.

I asked my fair, one happy day,
⁶ What Ι should call her in my lay,
By what sweet name, from Rome or Greece—
Galatea, Oelia, Chloris,
Laura, Lesbia, or DoriS,

Dorimene or Lucreee ξ’

‘ Ah !‘' replied my gentle fair,
⁴ Beloved‚ what are names but air?
Ohoose thou whatever suits the line:
Gall me Oelia, call me Chloris,
Laura, Lesbia, or Doris,
Only, only, call me Thine?

Coleridge.
