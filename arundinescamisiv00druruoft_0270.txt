When (God knows) I'm tossed about
Either with despair or doubt;

Yet before the glass runs out-—

Sweet spirit, comfort me!

  

When the temptet me pursueth
With the sins of all my youth,

And half damus me with their truth—
Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

  

k When the flames and hellish eries
Fright my ears and fright my eyeS‚

ι Α1111 311 terrore me surprise—

³ Sweet spirit, comfort me!

When the judgment is revealed‚
And that open, which was scaled,
When to 11166 I have appealed—

Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

Ξιβεαίηι xix.

THE spacious firmament on high,

And all the blue ethereal sky,

The spangled heavenS‚ a Shining frame,
Their great original proclaim.
