When⁴ soon or late this feeble breath
No more to thee shall pray,
Support me through the vale of death,

And in the darksome way.

When elothed in fleshly weeds again
Ι wait thy dread deeree, >

J udge of the world, bethink thee then,

That Thou hast died for me!

Gon, that madest earth and heaven,
Darkness and light!

Who the day for toil hast given,
For rest· the night3

May thine angel guamds defend uS,

Slumber sweet thy merey send us,

Holy dreams and hopes attend us
This livelong night.
