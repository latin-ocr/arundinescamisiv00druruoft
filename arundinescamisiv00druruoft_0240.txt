’ἔπιε {otus Εὲαιετε.

How sweet it were, hearing *the downward stream,
With half-shut eyes ever to seem
Falling asleep in a half-dream!
To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,
Which will not leave the myrrh bush on the height;
Ι To hear each other's whispered speech3
Eating the lotoe, day by day,
To wateh the erisping ripples on the beaeh,
And tendet curving lines of ereamy spray:
To lend our· hearts and spirits wholly
To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
Ι To muse and brood and live again in memory‚
Ξ With the old faces of our infancy

ἐ Heaped over with a mound of grass,
Ξ Two handfuls of white dust shut in an urn of branse.

i Tennyson.

Ι

OEu marm.

  
    

To market, to market, to buy a plum bun;

Home again, home again, market is done.
