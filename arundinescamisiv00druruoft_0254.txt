Hm my chicken, my ohioken,
And hey my chieken, my deary !
Such a sweet pet as this
Was neither far nor neary.
Here we go up up up,
And here we go down down downy‚
And here we go backwards and fol-warde,
And here we go round round roundy!

MARY‚ Ι believed thee true,
And ,Ι was blest in thus believing;
But now I mourn that e'er I knew

A girl so fair and so deceiving.
Few have ever loved like me—

Yes, I have loved thee too sineerely!
And few have e'er deceived like thee:
Alas, deceived me too severely!

Fare thee well !-—yet think awhile

On one whose bosom bleeds to doubt thee;
Who now would rather trust that smile,

And die with thee, than live without thee.
Fare thee well l--I'll think of thee:

Thou leav'st me many a bitter token;
For see, distracting woman, see-—

My peace is gone, my heart is broken! ⁷

Moore.
