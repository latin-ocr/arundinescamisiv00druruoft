OEum assomling.

Hmm a sheer-hulk lies poor Tom Bowling,
The dal-ling of our crew;

No more he'll hear the tempest howling,
For death has broached him to,

His form was of the manliest beauty,

His heart was kind and soft3
Faithful below he did his duty,

But now he's gone alost.

Tom never from his word departed‚
His virtues were so rare3

His friends were many and true-hearted;
His Poll was kind and fair:

And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly
Full many 3 time and oft3

But mirth is turned to melancholy,

For Tom is gone alost.

Yet may poor Tom find pleasant weather
When he, who all oommands,

Shall give, to eall life's erew together,
The word to pipe all hands! Α

Thus Death‚ who kings and tars despatcheS,
In vain Tom's life has doffed3

For though his body's under hatcl1eS‚
His soul has gone alost.
