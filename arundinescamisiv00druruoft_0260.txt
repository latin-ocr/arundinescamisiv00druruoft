ARUNDINES ΟΑΜΙ.Ι

That if to Pleasure I incline,

No more I view her form in wine,
Nor if bleak Care besets my soul‚
Gan drown him in the sparkling bowl.

Farewell, farewell, delusive dream!

The joy of youth, the poet's theme3
Enchanting scenes of mirth and ὲ«ξ166,
When all was gay and all was free3

When infant love's first sparks were fanned,

Cemented friendship's strictest band,

And both together bore along

In union sweet the power of song.
Enchanting 8661168, that fancy loves,
That friendship's sacred voice approves;
On which remembrance oft shall dwell
With sad delight—dear sceneS, farewell!

Even sc, I've passed* the fatal line,
And other suns upon me shine:

But as the home-sick sailor sees

Mid the waste waves his native trees;
