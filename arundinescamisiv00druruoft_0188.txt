ΞΕΙεςῃ.

THE curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
, The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

, Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
’ ÷ Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
¹ And drowsy tinklings lun the distant folds:

ἶ Save that, from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
The moping owl does to the Moon complain
· Of such as, wandering near her secret bower‚
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elmS‚ that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap‚
Eaeh in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude forefathers of the hamlet' sleep.

The breezy call of incense-breathing Moru,

The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The eoek's shrill clarion‚ or the echoing horn,

No more shall ronse them from their lowly bed. ·

⁴ For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:

, No children run to lisp their sire's return,

Or olimb his knees the envied kiss to share.
