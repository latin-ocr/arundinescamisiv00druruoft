ARUNDINES cAMI.

OEbe zleeping {Balatu amalzmth.

A Toucn, a kiss! the eharm was smpt,
There rose a noise of striking eloekS‚
And feet that ran and doors that clapt‚
And barking dogs and erowing eoeks.
A fuller light illumined all,
A breeze through all the garden swept,
A sudden hubbub shookv the hall,
And sixty feet the fountain leapt.

The hedge broke in, the banner blew‚

The butler drank, the steward serawled‚
The fire shot up, the martin flew,

The parrot screamed, the peaeoek squalled.

The maid and page renewed their strife3
The palaee banged and buzzed and elaekt3

And all the long-pent stream of life

Dashed downward in a eatam-aet.

And last of all the king awoke‚
And in his ehair himself upreared,

And yawned and rubbed his face and spoke— >
‘ By holy rood, a royal heard!
