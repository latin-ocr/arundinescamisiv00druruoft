ARUNDINES CAMI.

‘⁶ For who would trust the seeming sigh
Of wife or pal-amour?

Fresh feroe will dry the bright blue eyes
We late saw streaming o'er.

For pleasures past I do not grieve‚

Nor perils gathering near;

My greatest grief is that I leave

No thing that claime a tear.

“ And now I'm in the world alone,
Upon the wide, wide sea:

But why should I for others groan‚
When none will sigh for me?

Perchanee my dog will whine in vain,
Till fed by stranger hands;

But long ere I come back again
He'd tear me where he stands,

“ With thee, my bark‚ I'll swiftly go
Athwart the foaming brine;

Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
So not again to mine.

Weleome‚ welcome, ye dark blue waves!
And when you fail my sight,

Weleome, ye deserte, and ye caves!
My native Land-——Grood Night !''
