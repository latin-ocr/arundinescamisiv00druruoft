ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEbe fflrama uf affe.

Am, the world's a stage,

And all the men and women merely players;

They have their exits and their 61111311665,

Α1111 0116 111311 111 1115 111116 plays many parts,

His acts being seven ages, At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms:

And then the whim'ng 5611001-110)1 with his 53161161
Α1111 shining morning face, ereeping like snail
Unwillingly 10 school. 'And then the lover
Sighing like furnaoe‚ with a woful ballad

Made 10 1115 mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier
Full of strange 031115, 31111 1163111611 like the pard‚
J ealous in honour, sudden and quiok in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation

Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,

With eyes severe, 31111 1163111 of formal 6111,

Full of wise saws 31111 modern instances3
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts

Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,

With speetaoles on nose 31111 pouoh on side;

His youthful hose well saved, a world too wide -
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice
