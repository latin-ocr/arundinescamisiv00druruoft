172 ARUNDINES CAMI.

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learned to stray3

Along the cool sequestered vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenour of their way.

ἶ Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect,
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,

Ξ With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deckeds

Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

ι Their name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered Muse‚
The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews²
That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For wh0‚ to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resigned,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing‚ lingering look behind?

ὲ On some fond breast the parting soul relies
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature crieS‚
E'en in our ashes live their wonted fireS.

ξ ³ For thee, wh0, mindful of th' unhonoured dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate3

If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,

ξ Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,
