ARUNDINES CAMI.

Take all that's mine beneath the moon, ,
If I with her but half a noon

May sit beneath the walls
Of some old cave or mossy nook‚

Whene'er she wanders up the brook

To hunt the waterfaIIS.

WHERE is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn
Where may the grave of that good man be?

By the side of a fount on the breast of Helvellyn,
Under the twigs of a young bireh tree.

The oak that in summer was pleasant to hear,
And rustled its leaves at the fall of the year,
And bellowed and whistled in winter alone,
Is gone—in its place the bireh tree is grown.

The knight's bones are dust,

And his goed sword rust—-

His soul is with the saints Ι trust!
