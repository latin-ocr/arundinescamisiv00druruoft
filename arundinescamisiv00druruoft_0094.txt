RomN and Riohard

Were two pretty men:
They both lay in bed

Till the clock struck ten;
Then up {tarts Robin

And looks at the sky;
Oh! brother Richard‚

The sun's very high!

 

You go before
With your bottle and bag;
And I will come after

On little jaek nag.

In whispers of the summerre air3

I'll see the brightnesse of thine eye ξ

In the blue eveninge's shininge starre3

In moonlighte beames thy puritie3
And look on heavenne‚ to look on thee! ν
