OEu (παῖε.

Omma, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas

Of wheat‚ rye‚ barley‚ vetcheS‚ oats and peas;

Thy turfy mountainS, where live ·nibbling sheep,
And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep:

’ Thy bank with pionied and twilled brimS,
’ Which spungy April at thy hest betrims,

 

, To make cold nymphs chaste crowns3 and thy broom -

oveS,
Whose gghadow the djsmissed bachelor loves»,

j Being lass-lorn3 thy pole-elipt vineyard;

And thy sea-marge sterile and rocky-hard‚

j Where thou thyself dost air—the queen o' the sky,

¹ Whose watery arch, and messenger am I,

Bids thee leaVe these3 and with her sovereign grace,

’ Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,

¹ To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain3

Approach, rich CereS, her to entertain.
Shakspeare.

OEbe wilemma.

IF all the world were apple pie,
And all the sea were ink,

And all the trees were bread and eheese,
My Stars! what should we drink? “

Gammer Gur-ton.
