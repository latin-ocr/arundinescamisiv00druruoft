Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,

Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
How jocund did they drive their team a-field !

How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke !

Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,

Their homely joys, and destiny obsoure;
Nor Grandem· hear with a disdainful smile‚

The short and simple annals of the poor.

The boast of herddry, the pomp of power,
’ And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
‘ Await alike the inevitable hom-2
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye· proud, impute to ‘these the fault,

If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
Where through the long drawn 61616 and fretted mult,
The pealing anthem swells the note os praise.

Oan storied urn or animated bust

Baok to its mansion 6611 1116 fleeting breath'ff
Gan Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,

Or Flattery soothe the dull oold ear of Death3

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestia] fire;
HandS, that 1116 rod of empire might have swayed‚ ’
01· waked to eostasy the living lyre.
