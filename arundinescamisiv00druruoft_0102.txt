ARUNDINES CAMI.

 

anatoliae.

I'LL bid the hyacinth to blow,
I'll teach my grotto green to be,
And sing my true love all below
The holly bower and myrtle tree.

There all his wild-wood sweets to bring,
The sweet South Wind shall wander by,
And with the musio of his wing
Delight my rustling oanopy.

Come to my close and elust'ring bower,
Thou spirit of a milder elime,
Fresh with the dews of fruit and flower‚

And mountain heath and moory thyme:

With 'all thy rural eehoes come,
Sweet comrade of the rosy Day;

Wafting the wild bee's gentle hum,
And euokoo's plaintive roundelay.

Where'er thy morning breath has played
Whatever isles of Ocean fanned‚

Come to my blossom—woven Shade, ὅ
Thou wandering wind of fairy land.

For sure from some enchanted isle,
Where Heaven and Love their sabbath hold,
Where pure and happy spirits smile, ·
Of beauty's fairest brightest mould;
