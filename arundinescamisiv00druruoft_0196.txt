174 ARUNDINES CA MI.

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say3

‘ Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn,
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,

To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

There at the foot of yonder nodding beech,
That wreaths its old fantastic roots so high,
³ His listless length at noontide would he streteh,
And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

ἔ Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in soom,

., Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove,
ξ Now drooping woeful wan, like one forlorn,
Ι Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.

One morn Ι missed him on the 'eustomed hill,
Along the heath and near his favourite tree3
ξ Another came3 nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he:

The next with dirges due in sad array
Slow through the chureh-way path we saw him borne.
Approaoh and read (for thou oanst read) the lay,
Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.'

OEbe OEpitaph.

Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth,
A youth to fortune and to fame unknown,
Fair Soienoe frowned not on his humble birth, ·
And Melancholy marked him for her own.
