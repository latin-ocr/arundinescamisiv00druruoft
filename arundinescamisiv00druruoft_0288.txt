ARUNDINES CAMI.

Bound upon the aecursed tree‚
sad and dying, who is He?

By the last and bitter ory,

The ghost given up in agony;
By the lifele‘ss body laid

In the chamber of the dead3

By the mourners come to weep,
Where the bones of J esus sleep;
Crucified! we know Thee now;

Son of Man! 'tis Thou! 'tis Thou!

Bound upon the accursed tree,

Diead and awful, who is He?

By the prayer for them that slew—

“ Lord, they know not what they do''—
By the spoiled and empty grave,

By the souls He died to save,

By the conquest He hath won‚ Ι

By the saints before his throne,

By the rain-bow round his brow—

Son of God! 'tis Thou! 'tis Thou!
Mflman.
