ARUNDINES CAM 1.

ἣβεεια.

I HA vn found Peaee in the bright earth,
And in the sunny sky;

By the low voice of summer seaS‚
And where streame murmur by.

I find it in the quiet tone
Of voices that I love;

By the fliekering of a twilight fire,
And in ἐι leafless grove:

I find it in the silent flow
Of solitary thought,
, In calm half—meditated dreamS,
And reasonings self taught.

But seldom have I found such Peaoe,
As in the soul's deep joy

Of passing onward, free from harm, ι
Through every day's employ.

If gems we seek, we only tire,
And lift our hopes too high:
The constant ⁴ flowers that line our way '

Alone ean satisfy. Afford·

OEhz Εῇτεηεὼίετ.

Wno comes here 3—A grenadier.
What d'ye want ἕ-Α pot of beer.
Where's your money ἓ-Ι forgot.
Get you gone, you drunken sot!

Gammer Gurton.
