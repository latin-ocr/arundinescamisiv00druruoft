ς OEbt Ξιβᾱίειῑε of fite.

         

Ἴ ⁸ No forest fell
Ἰ ’ When thou would'st build; no quarry sent its stores
¹. ‘ To enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floodS,
j And make thy marble of the glassy wave.

      
     
       

ἶ In such a palace Aristaeus found

 

' ᾧ Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale

Ᾰ Of his lost bees to her maternal ear:

  
      
 
       
           
         
        
 

ξ In sueh a palaee poetry might place
The armoury of winter, where his trOOPS‚

ξ The gloomy cloudS, find weapons‚ arrowy sleet,
Q Skin-piereing volley, blossom-bruising hail.

» ἵ, Silently as a ⁷dream the fabric rose,

Ῑ ᾗ No sound of hammer or of saw was there3

ζ 1 Iee upon ioe, the well-adjusted parts

· ἓ Were soon conjoined, nor other cernent asked
Ἴ Than water interfused to make them one.

> ἶ Lamps gracefully disposed and of all hues

> ξ Illumined every side3 a watery light
ἒ Gleamed through the clear transpareney, that seemed
ἕ Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen

From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.

 

Cowper.
