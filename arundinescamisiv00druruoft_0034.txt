ARUNDINES CAM Ι.

{Ph he a aauttzrfly.

ΓΒ be a Butterfly born in a bower‚
Where roses and lilies and violets meet;
Roving for ever from flower to flower,
And kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet!
Γᾶ never languish for wealth or for power;
, I'd never sigh to see slaves at my feet:
I'd be a Butterfly born in a bower‚
Kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet.

O could I pilfer the wand of a fairy‚
Γᾶ have a pair of those beautiful wings:

Their summer-day's ramble is sportive and airy,

They sleep in a rose when the nightingale sings. Ι
These, who have wealth, must be watehful and wary3 ’

Power, alas! nought but misery brings!
Γᾶ be a Butterfly sportive and airy,
Rock'd in a rose when the nightingale sings!

What, though you tell me each gay little rover
Shrinks from the breath of the first autumn day!
Sure it is better, when summer is over,
To die when all fair things are fading away.
Some in life's winter may toil to. discover
Means of procuring a weary delay—
Γᾶ be a Butterfly; living a rover‚
Dying when fair things are fading away!
