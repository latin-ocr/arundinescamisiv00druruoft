ARUNDINES CAMJ.

{Rutulum} stum aeitknezs.

O SAvmuR of the faithful dead,
With whom thy servants dwell,
Though oold and green the turf is spread,
Above their narrow cell3

No more we cling to mortal clay,
We doubt and fear no more,

Nor shrink to tread the darksome way
Which thou hast trod before.

'Twas hard from those I loved to go,

Who knelt around my bed,
Whose tears bedewed my burning brOW,

Whose arms upheld my head!

As fading from my dizzy eyeSâ€š
I sought their forms in vain,
The bitterness of death I knew,

And groaned to live again.

'Twas dreadful when the accuser's power
Assailed my sinking beart,
Reeounting every wasted hour,
And each unworthy part:

But, J esne, in that mortal fray,
Thy blessed comfort stole,
Like sunshine in a stormy day,
Across my darkened soul.
