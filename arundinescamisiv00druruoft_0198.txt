Large was his bounty, and, his soul sincere,

Heaven did a recompence as largely send:
He gave to Misery all he had—a tear3
He gained from Heaven—'twas all he wished—a friend.

No further seek his merits to diselose‚
- Or draw his frailties from their dread abode3
There they alike in trembling hope repose‚

The bosom of his Father and his God.

Ι wmwr to the toad that lies under the wall,
I charmed him out, and he came at my call:

I scratehed out the eyes of the owl before;

Ι tore the bat's wing—-what would you have more?

On! ever thus, from childhood’s hour,
I've seen my fondest hopes decay;
I never loved a tree or fiower‚
But 'twas the first to fade away.
I never nursed a dear gazelle‚
To glad me with its soft black eye,
But when it came to know me well,

And love me, it was sure to die.
Moore.
