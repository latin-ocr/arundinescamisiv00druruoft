: l Tun Moon had climbed the highest hill ,
l Which rises o'er the source of Dee,
And from the eastern summit shed
Her silvery light o'er tower and tree;

When Mary laid her down to sleep,
Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea, ξ
When low and soft ar voice she heard l
Say———‘ Mary, weep no more for me.'

She from her pillow gently raised j
Her head, to see who there might be;

She saw young Sandy shivering stand,
With visage pale and hollow e'e.

⁶ Ο Maiden dear⁹ cold is my clay,
‘ It lies beneath a stormy sea;

‘ Far far from thee I sleep in death,
‘ So, Mary‚—weep no more for me.

‘ Ο Maiden dear, thyself prepare,
⁶ We soon shall meet upon that shore,
⁶ Where love is free from doubt and care,
‘ And we shall meet to part no more?

Loud crowed the cock3 the Shadow fled3 ὲ
, No more of Sandy could she see; ζ
But soft the parting Spirit said— ²

‘ Sweet Mary, weep no more for me.'
