ARUNDPNES CAMI.

assermuna.

anm the remote Bermudas ride

In Ocean's bosom unespied‚

From a small boat that rowed along,
The listening winds received this song.

“ What should we do but sing his praise
That led us through the watery mam,
Unto an isle so long unknown,

But yet far kinder than our own? Δ
Where he the huge sea-monsters wr-acks,
That lift the deep upon their backS.

He lands us on a grassy stage,

Safe, from the storms and prelates' rage.
He gave us an eterna] spring,

Which here enamels every thing;

And ‘sends the fowls to us in care,

In daily visits through the air.

He hangs in shades the orange bright,
Like golden lamps in a green night;
And does in the pomegranates close

J ewels more rich than Ormus shows„

He makes the figs our mouths to meet,

And ‘throws the melons at our feet:
But apples plants of such a price,
No tree could ever bear them twice.
