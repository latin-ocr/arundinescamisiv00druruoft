ARUNDINES CAMI.

eene to &bimaita

DAUGHTER of Jove, relentless power,

Thou tamer of the human breast,

Whose iron seourge and torturing hour

The bad affiight, affliet the best!

Bound in thy adamantine chain,

The proud are taught to taste of pain,

And purple tyrants vainly groan

With pange unfelt before, unpitied and alone.

When first thy Sire to send on earth

Virtue, his darling child, designed,

Το thee he gave the heavenly birth,

And bad to form her infant mind.

Stern rugged Nurse l thy rigid lore

With patience many a year she bore;

What sorrow was thou bad'st her knOW,

And from her own she learned to melt at others' woe.

Gray.
