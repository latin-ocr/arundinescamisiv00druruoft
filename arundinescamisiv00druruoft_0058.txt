Hm( diddle diddle! the cat and the fiddle!
The oow jumped over the moon;
The little dog laught to see such fine sport;

And the dish ran away with the spoon. eurto

On! how hard it is to find

The one just suited to our mind!
And if that one should be

False, unkind, or found too late,

What can we do but sigh at fate,
And sing, ⁶ Woe's me! woe's me ΓΞ

Love's a boundless burning waste,

Where Bliss's stream we seldom taste,
And still more seldom fiee

Suspense's thornS, Suspicion's stings:
Yet somehow Love a something brings

That's sweet‚ e'en when we sigh ⁴ Woe's me Γ

Luern Bopeep has >lost her sheep,
And does not know where to find them:
Let them alone, and they'll soon come home,
And bring their tails behind them.
