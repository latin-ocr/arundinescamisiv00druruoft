ARUNDINES CAMI.

From some green Eden of the deep,
Where Pleasure's sigh alone is heaved‚

Where tears of rapture lovers weep,
Endeared, undoubting‚ undeceived;

From some sweet Paradise afar
Thy music wanderS‚ distant, lost3
Where Nature lights her leading star,
And love is never, never crossed.

Oh! gentle gale of Eden bowerS‚
If back thy rosy feet should roam,
To revel with the cloudless Hours
In Nature's more propitious home,

N ame to thy loved Elysian groveS,
That o'er enehanted spirits twine,
A fairer form than Cherub loves»,

And let that name be GARomNE!
Campben.
