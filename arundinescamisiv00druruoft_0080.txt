 

ARUNDINES CAMI.

 

Qum ’itanu ᾖριιε.

SHOULD auld acquaintance be forgot‚
And never brought to min'Z

Should auld acquaintance be forgot‚
And days o' lang syne?

For auld lang syne‚ my dear‚
For auld lang syne‚

We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.

We twa hae run about the brace,

But we've wandered mony a weary foot
Sin' auld lang syne.

And pu't the gowans fine3 ἱ

We twa hae paidl't in the burn
From morning sun till dine;
But seas between us braid hae roared

Sin' auld lang syne.

And here's a hand, my trusty fier,
And gie's a hand o' thine;

And we'H tak a right good willie waught‚
For auld lang syne.

And surely ye'll be your pint-stoup‚
And surely I'll be mine;

And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.
