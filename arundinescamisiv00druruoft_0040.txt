Yon must mind and call me early, eall me early, Mother
dear,

Ξ To-morrow 'll be the happiest time of all the glad New-year3 Ξ Ξ
ἶ Of all the glad N ew-year, mother, the maddest merriest day,

J For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
,Ξ o' the May. Ξ

Ξ There's many a blaek blaek eye, they say, but none so Ξ
bright as mine; Ξ
ἶ There's Margaret and Mary, there's Kate and Oaroline3
Ξ But none so fair as little Alice in all the land they say3 ;
Ξ For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen ὲ
o' the May.

I sleep so sound all night, mother, that I shall never wake, Ξ

If you do not call me lond, when the day begins to break ; Ξ

But I must gather knots of flowerS, and buds, and garlands Ξ
gay,

For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
o' the May.

Ξ As I came up the valley, whom think ye should I see,

Ξ But Robert leaning on the bridge beneath the hazel-tree?

Ξ Η6 thought of that sharp look, mother, I gave him yester-

Ξ day— ,

Ξ But I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
o' the May. ’
