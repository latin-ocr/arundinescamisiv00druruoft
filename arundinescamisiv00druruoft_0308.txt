ARUNDINES CAMI.

But howsoever fresh and fair
Its morning beauty shOWS,

'Tis all cut down and withered quite
Before the evening close.

We hy thine anger are consumed,
And by thy wrath dismayed:

Our public crimes and secret sins
Before thy sight are laid.

Beneath thy anger's sad effects

Our drooping days ’we spend;

Our unregarded years break off,
Like tales that quickly end.

Our term of time is seventy yearS‚
An age that few survive;
But if with more than common strength

To eighty we arrive;

Yet then our boasted strength decayS,
To sorrow turned and pain:
So soon the slender thread is cut,

And we no more remain.
