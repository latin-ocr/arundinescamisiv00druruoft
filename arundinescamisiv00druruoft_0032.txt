BoNNm lass, bonnie lass), will you be mine?
Thou shalt neither wash dishes nor serve the swine;
But sit on a cushion and sew up a seam,

And thou shalt have strawberries sugar and cream.
Gammer eumn.

I AM mad Tom‚ behold me!

My senses are gone from me3
I'm mad, I'm' sure,

’ I'm past all eure,

And Bedlam scarce can hold me.

I'll climb yon lofty mountain,
And there I'll fight the gypsiae3
I'll play at bowls
With the sun and moon,
And beat them both to eclipses.

I'm wiser than Ap0110;

For while he lay a sleeping‚
Ι saw the stars
Af, morta-l jars,

While Vulean was a weeping.
