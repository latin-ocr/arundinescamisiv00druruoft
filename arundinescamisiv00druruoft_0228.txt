ARUNDINES CAMI.

aaa the &ming

Lo! where the rosy-bosomed hours

Fair Venus' train appear,
Disclose the long-expecting flowers

And wake the purple year!

The attic warbler pours her throat
Responsive to the cuckoo's note,

The untaught harmony of spring:
While, whispering pleasures as they fly,
Oool Zephyrs through the clear blue sky

Their gathered fragrance fling.

Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch
A broader browner shade;

Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech
O'er-canopies the glade;

Beside some water's rushy brink

With me the Muse shall sit, and think
(At ease reclined in rustic state)

How vain the ardour of the crowd,

How low, how little are the proud‚

How indigent the great!

Still is the toiling hand of Care:
The panting herds repose:

Yet hark, how through the peopled ⁴air

 

The busy murmur glows !
