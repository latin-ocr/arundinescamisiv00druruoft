ARUNDINES CAMI.

OEby mill ht hune.

MY God, my Father‚ while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way,
O teach me from my heart to say,

Thy will be done ! ’

Though dark my fate and sad my lot,

Let me be still and murmur not;

But breathe the prayer divinely taught—
Thy will be done !

What though in lonely grief 1 sigh
For friends beloved„ no longer nigh,
Submissive I would still reply—

Thy will be done ἰ

If thou should'st call me to resign ’
What most I prize, it 116”’61· was mine,
I only yield thee what was thine—

Thy will be done !

If sickness wastes 1116 to decay,
, · Let me ’ with ‘humble saith obey,

. And teach thy servant still to pray—
Thy will be done !

Renew my will from day to day,

Blend it with thine, and take away

All that now makes it hard to say—-

’ Thy will be done 1

Elh'ot.
