ARUNDINES CAMI.

Game down upon my heart. ‘ My own OEnone‚

Beautiful brow'd OEnone‚ my own soul,

Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingraven

‘ For the most fair,' would seem to award it thine‚

As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt

The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace

Of movement‚ and the eharm of married brows?
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.

He prest the blossom of his lips to mine,

And added, ⁶ This was cast upon the board,

When all the full-faeed presence of the Gods

Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon

Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due:

But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve‚

Delivering that to me, by common voice

Elected umpire, Here eomes to-day‚

Pallas and Aphrodite, elaiming each

This meed of fairest. Thou, within the eave

Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine‚

Mayst well behold them unbeheld‚ unheard

Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods?

, Tennyson.

353an Qumpty.

HUMPTY DUMPTY sat on a wall;
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall:
Not all the King's horses, nor all the Queen's men,
Oould put Humpty Dumpty on the wall again. .
